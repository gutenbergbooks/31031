<p class="newsection"><span class="smcap">Though</span> the particulars connected with the Gunpowder
Treason may be perused in the general
histories of the period, yet I am not aware, that any
modern narrative of that dark design is to be found
in a separate form. Many brief sketches have, indeed,
been published in various modern works: but no full
and complete history of the Treason has ever been set
forth. In compiling the present volume, I have collected,
from various quarters, all the information which
I could discover on the subject. It will be found to
be the most complete narrative of the Treason ever
published in a detached form: at the same time it is
sufficiently concise not to weary the patience of the
reader.</p>

<p>As to the seasonableness of such a publication,
there can be but one opinion among Churchmen.
The aspect of the times, the rapid advances of
Romanism, the appointment of certain Roman Catholics
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>to high and important offices in the State, and the
countenance given to Popery in high places, are circumstances
which naturally direct the attention of all
reflecting persons to the principles of that Church,
which has recently appeared to gain fresh strength in
this country. The question must force itself upon the
notice of every true Protestant. The Church of
England is assailed on every side, simply because she
is the strongest bulwark ever erected against the
encroachments of Popery: and history proves that,
from the period of the Reformation, our own Church
has been unceasingly attacked, in some way or other,
by the advocates of Romanism. It is, therefore, very
desirable that we should consult the past history of
our country, in order that we may discover how the
active emissaries of Rome have always acted. The
Gunpowder Treason is one of the darkest tragedies in
our domestic history: and the present work contains a
faithful narrative of that detestable conspiracy. I
have endeavoured also to exhibit the principles on
which the conspirators acted: and I have proved that
these principles are still retained by the Church of
Rome.</p>

<p>In order to furnish the reader with a full view of
the working of Popish principles, I have given a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[v]</a></span>sketch of all the Papal attempts against Queen
Elizabeth.</p>

<p>In the last chapter I have inserted the Act of
Parliament for the Observance of the Fifth of November.
I have printed the Act, because there are many
clergymen who have never seen it, and who are not
acquainted with the few works in which it is to be
found. The clergy are commanded to read this Act
every year, on the Fifth of November: and as it is
not easily to be procured, or, at all events, is not
attainable in a separate form, I cannot but conceive
that I am performing an acceptable service, in thus
placing it before the public. It is my earnest hope
that the publication of this little volume may be the
means of bringing some of my clerical brethren to a
better observance of the day.</p>

<p>I have also noticed the variations which the Service
for the Fifth of November has undergone, since its
first publication in 1606, to its final revision in 1689.</p>

<p>It is true that every one knows something of the
history of the Gunpowder Treason: but it is also true,
that very few are acquainted with those principles
which gave it birth. We see, in this treason, to what
lengths the principles of the Church of Rome have led
their votaries: and who can assert that she is, in any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>respect, changed? The Romanist denies that the
principles of his Church are changed: nay, he must
do so, or renounce the doctrine of infallibility, which is
incompatible with change: why, then, should Protestants
volunteer assertions, respecting the altered character
of Popery, when the Papists themselves deny
the fact altogether? I may venture to assert that the
individual who advances such a statement, is ignorant
of the real principles of the Church of Rome.</p>

<p class="summary long">A SKETCH OF PAPAL ATTEMPTS IN ENGLAND AND IRELAND
DURING THE REIGN OF ELIZABETH. THE STATE
OF RELIGION AND THE COUNTRY ON JAMES&#8217;S ACCESSION.</p>


<p class="newsection"><span class="smcap">As</span> an introduction to the subject, of which this volume
professes more especially to treat, I purpose to give a sketch
of the proceedings of the emissaries of Rome in this country,
during the long reign of Queen Elizabeth. Queen
Mary died <small>A.D.</small> 1558, when her sister Elizabeth succeeded
her on the throne. Paul IV. at this time occupied the
papal chair: but in less than a year after her accession he
was removed by death, and was succeeded by Pius IV.
Both these pontiffs were quiet and moderate men, compared
with several of those who came after them. At
all events, they did not proceed to those extremities to which
their successors resorted. There were, indeed, parties in
the court of Rome, who laboured to induce these pontiffs
to excommunicate the queen, as a heretic and a usurper;
but recollecting the fatal consequences which had issued
from the hasty proceedings of Clement against Henry VIII.,
or, probably imagining that greater benefits would result
from gentle than from violent measures, they pursued a
moderate course, exhorting the queen to return to her allegiance
to the see of Rome, and even making promises of
concessions respecting the reformation. In 1566, Pius V.
was promoted to the papal chair. In a very brief space he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>gave indications of a departure from the moderate councils
of his two immediate predecessors. The efforts of Philip II.
of Spain were also, during the early years of this reign,
directed to the same object with those of Paul IV. and
Pius IV. The king was anxious to marry Elizabeth, in
order that he might exercise his influence in England; and
as long as he could entertain a hope that his wishes would
be realized, he seconded the moderate measures of the
Roman pontiff. His expectations on this subject were
destined to disappointment; when perceiving that a marriage
with the queen was out of the question, he directed
his attention towards the accomplishment of his designs on
this country by other means than those of treaty and
diplomacy.</p>

<p>As soon as Pius V. was fixed in the papal chair a different
line of policy, therefore, was pursued towards England.
Some few years, indeed, elapsed before the queen
was actually excommunicated; but conspiracies and treasons
were contrived at Rome, with a view to their execution, as
soon as suitable persons could be found for the purpose.</p>

<p>Pius V. was the pontiff by whom the bull of excommunication
against Elizabeth was issued. The document was
dated March, 1569, or 1570, according to the present mode
of computation. Hitherto the court of Rome had abstained
from any direct attempt against the queen and the country:
but from this time plots were contrived and treasons planned
in rapid succession; for when one scheme was frustrated,
by the vigilance of the government, another was adopted;
so that the whole reign of Elizabeth, with the exception of
the early portion of it, was constantly developing some
machination or other, devised by the emissaries of Rome.
At the head of the confederacy against the queen were the
pope and the king of Spain, who hated her with the most
deadly hatred,&mdash;the former, because she was the chief stay
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>of the reformation, the latter, because she was an obstacle
to the prosecution of his designs on this country<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>.</p>

<p>The first act of rebellion was the attempt of the earls of
Westmoreland and Northumberland. This was soon after
the bull was issued. In all the treasons and rebellions of
this reign some of the priests of Rome were more or less
concerned; and these two earls were instigated to the
attempt by Morton, an Englishman and a priest, who was
sent into England by the pope himself, for the express purpose
of stirring up rebellion. This design, however, was
strangled in its birth, and its promoters paid the penalty of
their lives.</p>

<p>In 1576 Pius V. paid the debt of nature, and was succeeded
by Gregory XIII., who did not depart from the
practices of his predecessor. Stukely, another subject of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>the queen&#8217;s, was authorised to go into Ireland by his holiness
and the king of Spain; and the pope had the presumption
to pretend to confer the title of marquis and earl of
several places in that country. He was commissioned to
stir up rebellion, the pope engaging to supply men, and the
king of Spain promising supplies of money. The purpose
was, however, defeated: but the next year several individuals
were actually sent into Ireland, accompanied, as usual,
by Sanders, a priest, who was possessed with legantine
authority from his holiness. To encourage the Irish, a
banner, consecrated by the pope, was sent over, and every
other means was resorted to, which the most inveterate
enmity could devise. The pontiff also sent them his
apostolical benediction, granting to all who should fall in
the attempt against the <i>heretics</i>, a plenary indulgence for all
their sins, and the same privileges as were conferred on
those who fell in battle against the Turks. Sanders, however,
died miserably, and the attempt completely failed.</p>

<p>It was about the year 1580 that the seminary priests,
who were so designated from the circumstance of being
trained in certain seminaries on the Continent, instituted
especially for English priests, began to come over into
England for the express purpose of enforcing the bull of
excommunication against the queen. These men were
natives of England, though educated on the Continent.
They assumed various disguises on their arrival, travelling
from place to place to promote the grand design, which had
been projected at Rome. They endeavoured to execute the
bull by making various attempts upon the queen&#8217;s life, from
which, however, she was mercifully delivered. Two points
were constantly kept in view: the one to stir up dissensions
at home, among the queen&#8217;s subjects; the other to induce
the papal sovereigns to promise men and arms, whenever it
should be deemed desirable to make a descent on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>country. Many of these men were executed as traitors,
though the Romanists pretend that they were martyrs for
their religion<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>. It is true that their religious views led
them into treason and rebellion; yet they were no more
martyrs for their faith than the murderer who was executed
at Tyburn. Parsons and Campion were the leaders of this
body: the former escaped to the Continent, the latter was
taken and executed for his treasonable practices.</p>

<p>It is constantly asserted by Roman Catholic writers,
that the priests who suffered during this reign were martyrs
to the faith: and the inference is attempted to be drawn,
that the church of England is as much exposed to the
charge of persecution as the church of Rome. One thing
is certain, however, that, whether the advisers of Elizabeth
were justified in their course or otherwise, they did not consider
that they were putting men to death for religion: but,
on the other hand, the martyrs under Queen Mary were committed
to the flames as heretics, not as traitors or offenders
against the laws of the land. When, therefore, Romanist
writers attempt to draw a parallel between the martyrs of
the Anglican church under Queen Mary, and the priests
who suffered in the reign of Elizabeth, it is a sufficient
answer to their cavils to allege the fact, that the former
were put to death according to the mode prescribed in cases
of heresy, which was an offence against religion; the latter
were tried and executed for treason, which is an offence
against the state. It is the remark of Archbishop Tillotson
that, &#8220;We have found by experience that ever since the
reformation they have continually been pecking at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>foundations of our peace and religion; when God knows we
have been so far from thirsting after their blood, that we
did not so much as desire their disquiet, but in order to
our own necessary safety, and indeed to theirs.&#8221;</p>

<p>In 1583 Somerville attempted to kill the queen. The
plot was discovered, and its author only escaped a public
execution by strangling himself in prison.</p>

<p>In 1585 another plot was revealed. Parry, who had
been employed on the Continent, came into England with a
fixed determination to take the life of the queen. To this
act he was instigated by the pope, who sent him his benediction,
with a plenary indulgence for his sins. He was
discovered and condemned. On his trial he produced the
pope&#8217;s letter, which had been penned by one of the
cardinals.</p>

<p>At this time, when it was found that all the plots were
secretly contrived or supported by the seminary priests, certain
severe statutes were enacted. The priests, whose only
occupation in England was to stir up rebellion, were commanded
to quit the country, or be subjected to the charge
of treason. These enactments were absolutely necessary,
for every priest was a traitor: nor was it possible that it
should have been otherwise, where the pope himself encouraged
them in their designs.</p>

<p>During this year Sixtus V. was elected pope in the room
of Gregory XIII. This pontiff walked in the steps of his
immediate predecessors. It should be stated, that at that
time the doctrine was inculcated, that it was meritorious to
kill heretics, and those who were excommunicated. To die,
therefore, in any such attempts, as those to which I have
alluded, was deemed the readiest way to the crown of martyrdom,
which was coveted by many members of the church
of Rome. When such doctrines were believed, we cannot
be surprised that so many treasons and rebellions were
contrived.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>In 1586 the life of the queen was attempted by Babington.
The plot was discovered, and he and several of his
accomplices were executed.</p>

<p>Thus it became necessary to frame new laws to prevent
the plots of the seminary priests, who flocked into England
for the sole purpose of exciting rebellion. A statute was,
therefore, passed, by which it was made treason for any
one, who had been ordained a priest by authority of the
see of Rome, since Elizabeth&#8217;s accession, to come into her
dominions. This act was charged with cruelty at the time,
and the charge is still repeated, not only by Romanist, but
by many other writers: yet the act was absolutely necessary
in self-defence. It was intended to keep the priests
out of the country, since their coming always issued in
treason and the consequent loss of their lives. Let it be
remembered that the laws against recusants were not
enacted until the treasons of Campion, Parry, and others,
had rendered such a step on the part of the government
unavoidable. The course adopted to prevent the coming
of the priests was a merciful one, for it was supposed
that they would not venture into England at the peril
of their lives: it was also a reasonable one, since no
sovereign was ever known to permit men to reside in his
dominions, who denied that he was the lawful prince, and
who endeavoured to withdraw his subjects from their allegiance,
or stir them up to rebellion. As early even as the
reign of Edward I., to bring in a bull from Rome was
adjudged to be treason<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>The next year a similar plot, which was devised by an
Englishman of the name of Moody, was brought to light.
All these attempts were directed against Elizabeth herself;
and though Englishmen were the traitors, who engaged to
carry the plots into execution, yet they were encouraged in
their work, and supported both by the pope and the king of
Spain. The intention of the papal party was to dethrone
Elizabeth, and seat Mary, queen of Scots, on the throne.
No one will justify Elizabeth in taking the life of Mary:
but it may be observed that if no attempts had been made
against the queen&#8217;s life, and if the court of Rome had
acted justly and honourably, the ministers of Elizabeth
would never have recommended the execution of that unfortunate
queen. Her death must be attributed to Romish
principles, and to the papal attacks on the Protestant
religion<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>.</p>

<p>The year 1588 is memorable in English history for
the defeat of the <i>Spanish Armada</i>, impiously called the
<i>Invincible Armada</i>. Several years were occupied in its
preparation; and the enemies of England expected to overwhelm
the country by one stroke. At this time the pope
issued another bull against the queen, in which it was pretended
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>that she was deprived of her royal dignity and
kingdom, while her subjects were absolved from their
allegiance. The same document commands all Englishmen
to unite with the Spaniards on their landing, and to submit
themselves to the Spanish general. Ample rewards also
are promised to any who shall deliver the <i>proscribed
woman</i>, as she is termed, into the hands of the papal party;
while a full pardon was granted to all who should engage in
the enterprise. It was determined that King Philip should
hold the kingdom <i>in fee</i> from the pope. To accomplish
their purpose, the Armada was fitted out.</p>

<p>Though King Philip was the individual, by whom the
Armada was fitted out, yet he was encouraged in the
designed invasion by the pope as well as by the English
fugitives on the Continent, headed by Sir William Stanley.
The war with Portugal had, for some years, prevented
Philip from bending all his energies towards the conquest
of England. Being successful in his attempts on his
neighbours, and also in the East Indies, it was argued by
his flatterers that equal success would attend his efforts
against England. Nor was another argument forgotten as a
spur to his diligence, namely, that the conquest of England,
with the consequent re-establishment of popery, would be
an acceptable service to God, who had given him his great
success against his enemies, and that no action could be
more meritorious. It is stated that a hundred <i>Monks</i> and
<i>Jesuits</i> accompanied the expedition; while Cardinal Allen,
an Englishman, was appointed superintendent of ecclesiastical
affairs throughout England. After having suffered
much from the fire of the English fleet, as well as from
the violence of the tempests, many of their ships being
disabled, it was determined to attempt to return home
through the Northern Ocean. At this time the powder of
the English fleet was almost exhausted; so that the departure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>of the Spanish vessels, at this juncture, must be
regarded as an interposition of divine providence in favour
of our country. Many of the vessels which thus escaped
from the English fleet, never reached the coast of Spain,
being wrecked in different places. Elizabeth displayed a
most magnanimous spirit during the time that the Armada
was hovering around our coasts. She addressed the army
in terms calculated to inspire them with confidence, and to
endear them to her person. A solemn fast had been
observed when the danger threatened; and when the deliverance
of the country was manifest, a solemn thanksgiving
was offered up in St. Paul&#8217;s Cathedral on the 8th of
September, when some of the Spanish ensigns lately taken
were hung about the church. On Sunday, September
24th, the queen herself proceeded to St. Paul&#8217;s, and on
arriving at the west door, she knelt down within the
church, and in an audible voice praised God as her only
defender against her enemies. It was further ordered that
the 19th of November should be observed as a day of
thanksgiving throughout the country; which day was
annually commemorated during the reign of Elizabeth<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>.</p>

<p>In 1590, Urban VII. became pope. He was succeeded
in a very brief space by Gregory XIV., who also was
speedily succeeded by Innocent IX. Nor did Innocent
occupy the papal chair for any lengthened period. In consequence
of the defeat of the <i>Armada</i>, and also of the
rapid changes in the holy see, three popes having died
within the space of eighteen months, there was a slight
cessation from the attempts against Elizabeth. In 1592,
Clement VIII. was elevated to the popedom: and under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>his auspices there was a revival of the previous practices,
which had not been given up, but merely relinquished for a
season. During the years 1592, 1593, and 1594, several
persons were commissioned by the court of Rome to raise
rebellions in England, and to poison or assassinate the
queen. The watchful eye of providence, however, was
extended over the country and the queen. Every plot was
discovered; every hostile design failed; and the only sufferers
were the traitors themselves.</p>

<p>Patrick Cullen received absolution and the sacrament,
<small>A.D.</small> 1592, from the Jesuit Holt, by whom it was determined
to be a meritorious deed to kill the queen; and in 1594,
Williams and York came over to England for the same
purpose, having first received the sacrament in the Jesuits&#8217;
college. In the year 1597, Squire came over from Spain
with the same object in view, namely, the assassination of
the queen; he also was instigated by Walpole, a <i>Jesuit</i>,
from whom he received the sacrament under a promise to
put the project in execution, and then conceal the deed. It
was observed by Sir Edward Coke, that since the Jesuits
set foot in England, there never passed four years without
a pernicious treason.</p>

<p>About this time the English fleet obtained a most
decisive victory over the Spanish. In 1598, Philip of
Spain, the great enemy of England, was removed by death
from that scene, in which he had, for so many years, acted
so conspicuous, yet inglorious a part.</p>

<p>In 1599 and 1600, a rebellion was headed in Ireland
by Tir Owen. This rebel chief was, as usual, encouraged
by the pope, who sent him a plume of feathers as a token of
his favour.</p>

<p>In 1603, the queen died in peace. From the preceding
abstract it will appear, that from the year 1570 to 1600,
Queen Elizabeth and the Protestant religion were constantly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>exposed to the machinations of the active partisans of the
Roman see, who were encouraged by the pope himself.
Every pontiff pursued the same course. There was a settled
purpose at Rome, and, indeed, throughout the whole Romish
confederacy, to dethrone Elizabeth and overturn the Anglican
church; nor is it a libel on the church of Rome to
say, that in all these proceedings, she acted on recognised
principles&mdash;principles which had received the solemn sanction
of her councils. To root out heresy, by any means
within their reach, was deemed, or at all events was
asserted to be a sacred duty incumbent on all the members
of the church of Rome. The doctrine may be denied in the
present day, when times and circumstances do not permit
of its being carried into practice; but, unquestionably, it
was not merely believed as an article of faith in the days of
Elizabeth, for we have seen that the attempt was made to
enforce the bull which was issued against the queen.</p>

<p>James I. succeeded to the throne at a period when the
eyes of Romanists were fastened on England as their prey.
During the latter years of Elizabeth, the emissaries of
Rome were comparatively quiet, in the hope that James,
from a feeling of filial reverence towards the memory of
his unfortunate mother, would not be unfavourably disposed
towards their church. It is certain, however, that a plot
was in agitation before the death of Elizabeth, being managed
by some of those individuals who were impatient of
waiting the course of events on the queen&#8217;s death. The
confessions and examinations of the conspirators show that
the powder plot was partly contrived before James&#8217;s accession.
Several of their number went into Spain to stir up the
Spanish court against the queen, and to request a foreign
army for the subjugation of England. The death of Elizabeth
took place while those proceedings were going forward
on the Continent, and was the means of suspending the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>operations of the conspirators for a season. As soon as
James&#8217;s accession was known, the king of Spain endeavoured
to enter into a negociation for peace, so that the
conspirators were not at this time openly favoured by that
monarch. It was supposed that some concessions might be
obtained from James in favour of his Roman Catholic subjects:
but in a very short space the leaders of the conspiracy
discovered, that they were not likely to gain much by
negociation. Unquestionably the Romanist party in England
endeavoured to induce the King of Spain to attempt
an invasion of the country: and it is equally certain, that
their solicitations would have been taken into serious consideration
if Queen Elizabeth had not died. Had the project
of invasion been realised, the conspirators would not
have proceeded to execute the Gunpowder Plot.</p>

<p>On the accession of James, therefore, there was a calm:
but it was deceptive: it was only the calm before the
storm; and to the eye of the careful observer, it indicated
any thing but prosperity and tranquillity. It was evident
to most men of reflection, that the storm was gathering:
nay, there were indications of its approach, though no one
knew how or where it would burst forth. The rolling of
the thunder was, as it were, heard in the distance, though
whether it would approach nearer or pass away altogether,
was a question which no one could determine.</p>

<p>I have glanced at the various treasons with which the
whole reign of Elizabeth was so pregnant: and the principles
from which they flowed have also been slightly alluded
to, namely, the principles of the church of Rome respecting
the punishment of heresy, and the keeping faith with heretics.
The doctrine of the church of Rome on this subject,
as expounded by the Jesuits, and especially by Parsons, who
at this period was one of the prime movers of every conspiracy
against the English sovereign, was this, namely, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>if any prince should turn aside from the church of Rome,
he would forfeit his royal power; and that this result would
follow from the law itself, both human and divine, even before
any sentence was passed upon him by the supreme
pastor or judge. This doctrine was a consequence of the
papal supremacy. The doctrine of the supremacy is
this&mdash;that the bishops of Rome, as successors of St. Peter,
have authority, derived to them from Christ himself, over
all churches, and kingdoms, and princes; that, in consequence
of this power, they may depose kings and absolve
their subjects from their allegiance, bestowing the kingdom
of the offender on another; that excommunicated princes
are not to be obeyed; and that, to rise in arms against
them, or to put them to death, is not only lawful, but meritorious.
Acting on these principles, Clement VIII. issued
certain bulls, in which he called upon all members of the
church of Rome to use their exertions for the purpose of
preventing the accession of James, whenever Queen Elizabeth
should depart this life.</p>

<p>Under such circumstances was James I. called to the
throne. The papal party were resolved on the execution
of their designs: and the pope and the king of Spain were
so far implicated, that they were fully aware, if not of the
particular nature of the intended plot, yet that certain
schemes would be resorted to for the accomplishment of
the grand object, which was the subjugation of England to
the papal yoke. Had the conspirators been successful, they
would have been furnished with all necessary supplies for
their purpose by the court of Rome, and those states which
were in alliance with the holy see. Such a combination
could not have been defeated by human means, especially
as the plot was carried on with the utmost secresy: but the
watchful eye of divine providence was fixed on the country,
and the designs of its enemies, as will be shown in this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>narrative, were mercifully frustrated. The bulls above
alluded to were to be kept secret as long as the queen survived.
They were addressed to the clergy, the nobility,
and the commons, who were exhorted not to receive any
sovereign whose accession would not be agreeable to the
pope. The reasons assigned by his holiness for recommending
such a course, were the honour of God, the restoration
of the true religion, and the salvation of immortal
souls. The Cardinal D&#8217;Ossat, to whom they were at first
entrusted, wrote to King James on the subject, expressing a
hope that he would openly profess the religion of his
mother. It will be seen, in a subsequent chapter, that
these bulls were committed to Garnet, who confessed that
they had been in his possession, and by whom they were
destroyed when it was found to be impossible to prevent
James from succeeding to the English throne.</p>

<p>Never, perhaps, in the history of the world was a sovereign
delivered from more conspiracies than Queen Elizabeth.
The efforts of her enemies were unceasingly directed
to one object, and that object was the queen&#8217;s death. Not
only were private individuals instigated to attempt her destruction,
but the most extensive confederacies were entered
into by almost all the papal sovereigns of Europe.</p>

<p>A remarkable circumstance is related of the hopes and
intentions of the Spaniards, in the event of success in the
<i>Armada</i>. A Spanish officer, who was taken prisoner, was
examined before the privy council. He confessed that their
object in coming was to subjugate the nation to the yoke of
Spain, and the church to that of the pope. He was asked
by some of the lords what they intended to do with the <i>Catholics</i>,
as some must necessarily have fallen: to which
question he promptly replied, that they meant to send them
directly to <i>heaven</i>, even as they should have sent the <i>heretics</i>
to <i>hell</i>. This statement rests on the authority of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>chaplain to the army. It was revealed to him in order that
he might publish it the next day, in his sermon, to the
troops. He states, that by commandment of the council
he did publish it to the army. In those days, there were
no <i>newspapers</i>: nor was it then so easy to communicate
intelligence by <i>placards</i> or <i>bills</i>. We find, therefore, that
the pulpit was often made a vehicle for publishing the common
news of the day. At a subsequent period, during the
commotions between Charles I. and his Parliament, when
the latter obtained possession of most of the pulpits, they
were the only channels through which many of the people
were made acquainted with the progress of the war. Whatever
had occurred during the week was published to the
people, from the pulpit, on the Sunday<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>.</p>

<p>King James, therefore, succeeded to the English crown
at a period when the pope and the papal sovereigns entertained
the most sanguine hopes of re-establishing popery in
this country, and when numbers of Jesuits and their disciples
were ready to execute any treason which might be
concocted.</p>

<div class="footnotes"><p class="footnotetitle">Footnotes:</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> I subjoin a few extracts from the bull issued against Elizabeth.
It was entitled <i>The Damnation and Excommunication of Queen Elizabeth.</i>
It commenced thus: &#8220;He that reigneth on high committed
one Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church (out of which there is no
salvation) to one alone upon earth, namely, to Peter, and to Peter&#8217;s
successor, the bishop of Rome. <i>Him alone he made prince over all
people, and all kingdoms, to pluck up, destroy, scatter, consume, plant,
and build, that he may contain the faithful that are knit together with
the band of charity, in the unity of the Spirit.</i>&#8221; Then, after an enumeration
of Elizabeth&#8217;s alleged crimes against the holy see, his holiness
proceeds: &#8220;We do, out of the fulness of our apostolic power,
declare the aforesaid Elizabeth, being a heretic, and a favourer of
heretics, to have incurred the sentence of <i>anathema</i>, and to be cut off
from the unity of the body of Christ. And, moreover, <i>we do declare
her to be deprived of her pretended title to the kingdom aforesaid, and
of all dominion, dignity, and privilege</i>. And also the nobility, subjects,
and people of the said kingdom, and all others, who have in any
sort sworn unto her, <i>to be for ever absolved from any such oath</i>. And
we do command and interdict all and every the noblemen, subjects,
and people, <i>that they presume not to obey her, or her monitions, mandates,
and laws</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is necessary to give these extracts in the outset, in order that it
may be seen that the gunpowder treason, and almost all other treasons
in the reigns of Elizabeth and James, flowed from the doctrines
thus promulgated by the papal see.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> For a full discussion of the question, whether the priests and
others who suffered death at this period and subsequently, were
punished for religion or for treason, the author&#8217;s work, <i>The State of
Popery and Jesuitism in England</i>, may be consulted. In that work
I have entered fully into the subject, and have proved that all the
parties who suffered were executed for treason.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> By the 27th Elizabeth, c. 2, it was enacted, &#8220;Because Jesuits,
seminary priests, or other priests came over into this realm of England,
of purpose, as it hath appeared by sundry of their own examinations
and confessions,&mdash;not only to withdraw her highness&#8217;s
subjects from their due obedience, but also to stir up and move
sedition, rebellion and open hostility&mdash;to the utter ruin, desolation,
and overthrow of the whole realm, if the same be not the sooner by
some good means foreseen and prevented, that it shall not be lawful
for any Jesuit, seminary priest, or other such priest&mdash;being born
within this realm&mdash;ordained by any authority derived from the see
of Rome, to come into, be, or remain in, any part of this realm: and
if he do, that then every such offence shall be taken and adjudged
to be high treason, and every person so offending shall for his
offence be adjudged a traitor.&#8221; This statute was rendered necessary
by the treasonable practices of the priests. Had they not been engaged
in such practices, the statute never would have been devised.
The only way, in which it can be said, that such priests suffered for
religion is this, namely, <i>that their religion led them into treason</i>; but
this would be to charge all their sufferings upon the church of Rome
herself, which is indeed the fact, though Romanists will not admit it.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> At this time Cardinal Allen, an Englishman, published a
defence of Stanley&#8217;s treason, maintaining that in consequence of the
queen&#8217;s excommunication and heresy, it was not only lawful, but a
duty to deprive her of the kingdom.</p></div>

<p class="summary short">SKETCHES OF THE CONSPIRATORS.</p>


<p class="newsection"><span class="smcap">The</span> persons actually engaged in this atrocious deed were
few in number: at the outset, indeed, very few: but the
design was gradually revealed to others, though even when
the discovery actually took place, the number was comparatively
small. That there was a general belief among the
Romanist body, that some great and effective blow would be
struck, is a fact which I need not attempt to prove, since it
is so well known, that no doubt can be entertained on the
subject: but how the design was to be carried into effect
was a secret to the great body of the Roman Catholics. The
conspirators were thirteen in number. Their names were
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<ul class="conspirators">
<li>Robert Catesby,</li>
<li>Robert Winter,</li>
<li>Thomas Percy,</li>
<li>Thomas Winter,</li>
<li>John Wright,</li>
<li>Christopher Wright,</li>
<li>Everard Digby, Knt.,</li>
<li>Ambrose Rookwood,</li>
<li>Francis Tresham,</li>
<li>John Grant,</li>
<li>Robert Keys,</li>
<li>Guy Fawkes,</li>
<li>And Bates, the servant of Catesby.</li>
</ul>

<p class="newsection">Of this number, five only were engaged in the plot at its
commencement, the rest being associated with them during
its progress. Several of them took no active part in the mine;
they were, however, in the secret, and furnished the money
necessary to carry on the work. Three Jesuits, as will
appear in the narrative, were also privy to the design, and
counselled and encouraged the conspirators. They were
Garnet, Gerrard, and Tesmond, <i>alias</i> Greenway. I shall
endeavour to place before the reader such particulars as I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>have been able to collect respecting all these individuals,
before I enter upon the narrative of the plot.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Robert Catesby.</span></h3>

<p>Catesby was the contriver of the conspiracy<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>. He
was a native of Leicestershire: a man of family and property,
and of such persuasive eloquence, that he induced
several of the conspirators to comply, who otherwise, in all
probability, would not have been implicated in the treason.
Some of them admitted, that it was not so much their conviction
of the justice of the cause that led them to engage
in the business, as the wily eloquence of Catesby. He was
descended from the celebrated minister of Richard III.
Little, however, is known of him beyond the part which he
acted in the Gunpowder Treason. It is evident that he was
a man of considerable abilities; but being a bigot to the
principles of the church of Rome, he was a fit instrument
for the execution of any plot, however horrible. Whether
he was influenced by the Jesuits, or whether prompted to
undertake the deed by his own feelings on the subject of
popery, is a question of no easy solution, since, in consequence
of his death, when the rest of his companions were
taken, no confession was given to the world, which would
probably have been the case, if he had been brought to trial
with the other conspirators. He was the only layman with
whom the Jesuit Garnet would confer on the subject of the
plot.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Thomas Percy.</span></h3>

<p>This gentleman was nearly allied to the earl of Northumberland,
by whom he was elevated to the post of captain
of the gentlemen pensioners. He appears to have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>been a man of great violence of temper; and his conduct
proves him to have been a staunch bigot to popery. Catesby
on some occasions found it necessary to restrain his violence,
lest his indiscretion should mar the whole contrivance. On
one occasion, he offered to rush into the presence-chamber,
and kill the king. He was killed with Catesby, at Holbeach,
shortly after the discovery of the treason.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Thomas Winter.</span></h3>

<p>It appears that Winter had contemplated a departure
from England altogether, when Catesby, who had entered
upon the plot, requested him to quit the country, whither
he had retired, till an opportunity should offer of going to
the Continent, and to come with all speed to London. The
scheme was proposed to Winter, who evinced no indisposition
to enter into the plot: on the contrary, he appears to
have complied, with the utmost readiness, with all Catesby&#8217;s
plans. Soon after this interview he went over to the Continent,
to reveal the design to some influential papists, with a
view to ascertaining their opinions on the subject. Winter
appeared at his execution to be penitent; but no hesitation
was manifested by him at the first; nor does he appear to
have entertained any scruples during the progress of the
conspiracy. In many respects, he appears to have been an
amiable man: but such principles as are inculcated by the
church of Rome, are calculated to quench all those feelings
of kindliness, which naturally exist in the human heart.
The breast of Thomas Winter was steeled by his principles
against the kindlier emotions of our common nature. It is
related of him, that he dreamt, not long before the discovery
of the treason, &#8220;that he saw steeples and churches
stand awry, and within those churches strange and unknown
faces.&#8221; When he was taken in Staffordshire, an explosion
of gunpowder took place, and some of the conspirators were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>scorched, and otherwise injured; at this time, his dream
was recalled to his remembrance, and he fancied that there
was a resemblance between the faces of the persons he had
seen in his dream, and those of his companions. The recollection
of the dream appears to have made a strong impression
on him at the period when he was taken into custody.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Robert Winter.</span></h3>

<p>This gentleman was the brother of the preceding, by whom
he was drawn into the conspiracy. Robert Winter was added
to their number some time after the mine had been commenced.
The circumstance caused some distress to Thomas
Winter, who petitioned the court at his trial, that, as he
had been the cause of his brother&#8217;s ruin, his death might
be considered as a sufficient atonement to the law for both.
Winter was taken in Staffordshire, where he retreated after
the discovery of the plot. For some time, he was concealed
in a house, whose occupant was a Roman Catholic. The
circumstance that led to his discovery was somewhat singular.
The cook was surprised at the number of dishes,
which were daily taken to his master&#8217;s room; he therefore,
to satisfy his curiosity, peeped through the keyhole, when
he saw a person sitting with his master. He was alarmed,
both on their account, and on his own; but his fears for his
own safety being greater than his apprehensions for Winter
and his master, he determined to make a discovery to one
of his relations. This step was followed by their apprehension.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Guido, or Guy Fawkes.</span></h3>

<p>Fawkes was a soldier of fortune, who for some years
was engaged in the Spanish service. Little is known of
his early life, except that he was a native of the county of
York, and received his education in the city of York. The
writer of the <i>Life of Bishop Morton</i> informs us that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>bishop and Fawkes were schoolfellows together in that city.
His subsequent history to the period of the treason, is but
imperfectly known. He appears to have been a bold and
daring adventurer, as well as a gloomy bigot to the worst
principles of popery; and was, in consequence, deemed by
Catesby to be a suitable instrument for his purpose. His
proceedings in the mine, as well as on the Continent, will
be noticed in the prosecution of the narrative.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">John Wright.</span></h3>

<p>John Wright was early engaged in the plot with Catesby.
It was agreed between these two individuals, Catesby and
Wright, that an oath should be administered to all who
should engage in the conspiracy. The oath will be given in
the narrative. John Wright was killed in the struggle with
the sheriff, in Staffordshire, where most of the conspirators
were taken subsequent to the discovery of the plot.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Christopher Wright.</span></h3>

<p>This person was the brother of the preceding, by whom
he was induced to enter into the conspiracy. He appears,
however, to have entered into the business with as much
zeal as any of the rest. He was the first to discover the
apprehension of Fawkes, on the morning of the Fifth of
November. His advice was, that each conspirator should
betake himself to flight in a different direction from any of
his companions. Had this advice been followed, several of
them would probably have succeeded in making their escape
to the Continent. The conspirators, however, adopted
another course, which issued in their discomfiture in Staffordshire,
where Christopher Wright was also killed.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Thomas Bates.</span></h3>

<p>Bates was a servant, and the only one of the conspirators
who did not move in the rank of a gentleman. When
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>the plot was concocting, he was servant to Catesby, the
leader in the treason. Catesby observed that his actions
were particularly noticed by his servant. The circumstance
led him to suspect, that Bates was in some measure acquainted
with their designs, or at all events, that he suspected
that they had some grand scheme in agitation. In the presence,
therefore, of Thomas Winter, Catesby asked him
what he thought the business was, which was then in contemplation.
Bates replied, that he thought they were contriving
some dangerous matter, though he knew not what
the particulars were. He was again asked what he thought
the business might be. He answered, that he thought they
intended some dangerous matter near the Parliament House,
because he had been sent to take a lodging near that place.
Bates was then induced to take an oath of secresy; when
the particulars were made known to him. It was then
stated that he must receive the sacrament, as a pledge that
he would not reveal the matter. With this view, he went
to confession to <i>Tesmond</i> the <i>Jesuit</i>, telling him that he
was to conceal a dangerous matter, which had been revealed
to him by his master, and Thomas Winter, and which he
feared was unlawful. He then disclosed the whole plot to
the Jesuit, desiring his counsel in the business. Tesmond
charged him to keep the matter strictly secret, adding, that
he was engaged in a good cause, and that it was not sinful
to conceal the plot. Bates then received absolution and
the sacrament, in company with Catesby and Winter. Such
were the means used to draw Bates into the conspiracy.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Francis Tresham.</span></h3>

<p>Tresham was also engaged in the plot at an early period.
He was not one of those with whom it originated; but it
was revealed to him when the parties were in want of
money, to enable them to carry on their scheme. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>offered to contribute 2000<i>l.</i> towards the grand object. He
died in the Tower before the trial of his companions.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Ambrose Rookwood.</span></h3>

<p>Rookwood was a man of fortune, and, until he became
implicated in this plot, of reputation. He was not one of
the original contrivers of the treason, but was drawn into
it by a strong affection for Catesby, who appears to have
exercised over him a most extraordinary influence.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">John Grant.</span></h3>

<p>Grant was a resident at Coventry, and, like Tresham and
Rookwood, did not labour in the mine, but was made acquainted
with the scheme after it had been concocted.
Grant seized upon several horses on the morning of the 6th
of November, supposing that the explosion had taken place,
with a view to the seizure of the Princess Elizabeth, then
on a visit in the neighbourhood. He was taken with the
other conspirators in Staffordshire.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Robert Keys.</span></h3>

<p>Little is known of this individual: but according to his
own account at his trial, his circumstances had always been
desperate, as well as his character. Such a man was,
therefore, ready for any enterprise, however criminal. Fuller
relates the following circumstance, which I give in his
own quaint language. &#8220;A few days before the fatal blow
should be given, Keies being in Tickmarsh, in Northamptonshire,
at his brother-in-law&#8217;s house, Mr. Gilbert Pickering,
a Protestant, he suddenly whipped out his sword, and
in merriment made many offers therewith at the heads,
necks, and sides, of several gentlemen and ladies then in
his company: it was then taken for a mere frolic, and so
passed accordingly: but afterward, when the treason was
discovered, such as remembered his gestures, thought he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>practised what he intended to do when the plot should take
effect: that is, to hack and hew, kill and destroy, all eminent
persons of a different religion from himself.&#8221;</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Sir Everard Digby.</span></h3>

<p>This gentleman was descended from an ancient family,
resident in Rutlandshire. His education was entirely
directed by priests of the church of Rome, his father dying
when he was only eleven years of age. He was introduced
to the court of Elizabeth at an early period of his life; and
soon after the accession of King James was knighted by
his majesty. Sir Everard was made acquainted with the
plot during its progress, when the early and original conspirators
found themselves in want of money. He promised
to furnish 1500<i>l.</i> He was taken after the discovery and
was executed in London.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Henry Garnet.</span></h3>

<p>Three Jesuits, Garnet, Gerard, and Tesmond, were
implicated in this conspiracy: the two latter escaped to
Rome, Garnet alone was taken and executed. It is remarked
by Fuller, &#8220;A treason without a <i>Jesuit</i>, or one of
<i>Jesuited principles</i>, therein, is like a drie wall, without either
lime or mortar; Gerard must be the cement, with the
sacrament of secrecie to join them together: Garnet and
Tesmond, (whelps of the same litter,) commended and encouraged
the designe<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>.&#8221; Garnet received his early education
in Winchester school, when Bishop Bilson was warden.
It is said that he was engaged in a conspiracy among the
boys, whose design was to cut off the right hand of their
master. At this time Garnet was at the head of the school.
His conduct in other respects seems to have been so immoral,
that he was advised not to offer himself as a candidate
for a scholarship at New College. He quitted Winchester
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>for Rome, where he enrolled himself in the society
of the Jesuits. At length he was made the superior of his
English brethren, in which character he returned into England,
to promote a rebellion against Queen Elizabeth. Other
particulars respecting his subsequent career will appear in
the narrative.</p>

<p>Thus have I endeavoured to give a brief sketch of the
actors in this dark transaction. In reading the pages of
history, we feel a natural desire to know something of the
persons, whose exploits are recorded. The particulars,
which I have given in this chapter, are such as could not so
well have been stated in the narrative. All other matters,
however, relative to any of the preceding individuals will be
woven with the history, on which I am now about to enter.</p>

<p>Other individuals were taken and executed for treason,
in consequence of their joining in the conspiracy; but the
parties mentioned in the preceding sketch were the only
persons, who were actually implicated in the plot by any
decided acts. It is pretty evident, too, that very few persons,
besides those actually engaged, were fully acquainted
with the particulars of the plot. It was the policy of the
conspirators to reveal the precise nature of the design to as
few as possible, feeling assured that the smaller the number
of actual traitors the less was the risk of discovery. They
were also aware, that all, or, at all events, most of the
Roman Catholics would join them, when the design was
carried into execution. The <i>Jesuits</i>, who were privy to the
plot, intimated to the great body of the Romanists, that
some great design was in agitation, without specifying particulars.
The actual plot, therefore, was confined to a very
few persons; but that a plot of some kind was going forward
was believed by the great body of the Roman Catholic
population throughout the country.</p>

<p class="summary long">PROCEEDINGS OF THE CONSPIRATORS, TO THE LATTER
END OF OCTOBER, 1605.</p>


<p class="newsection"><span class="smcap">Enough</span> has been detailed in the first chapter to show, that it
was the aim of the Romanists, throughout the reign of Elizabeth,
to overturn the church, and to assassinate the queen.
On James&#8217;s accession the same measures were resorted
to by the papal party, while the plots for the destruction of
Protestantism were as frequent as ever. In tracing the
origin of the powder plot it is necessary to look back to the
close of the reign of Elizabeth. In December, 1601, Garnet,
Catesby, and Tresham sent Thomas Winter into
Spain, with a view to obtaining assistance from the Spanish
monarch against England. It was always found in the projected
invasions of England, that one of the chief difficulties
was the transportation of horses. To obviate this difficulty,
therefore, the Roman Catholics of England, or Winter in
their name, engaged to provide 1500 or 2000 horses for the
use of the Spanish troops on their landing on our shores.
At this time one of the English Jesuits was resident in
Madrid; and by this man Winter was introduced to one of
the secretaries of state, by whom he was assured that the
king was anxious to undertake any enterprise against England.
The king of Spain further promised the sum of
one hundred thousand crowns, to be devoted to this special
service, and that he would effect a landing on the shores of
England during the next spring. Winter returned home
at the end of the year, and communicated his intelligence to
Garnet, Catesby, and Tresham. The death of the queen
took place soon after, when Christopher Wright was sent
over into Spain by Garnet, for the purpose of conveying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>intelligence of the queen&#8217;s death, and also for the furtherance
of the negotiation, which had been already entered
into during the previous year. Fawkes also arrived in
Spain soon after Wright. He had been sent from Brussels
by Sir William Stanley and Hugh Owen, two Englishmen,
who had been concerned in most of the treasons against
Elizabeth.</p>

<p>Some of the Jesuits were concerned in all the treasons
to which I have already alluded; and the gunpowder treason
was managed by the same party, the actors being either
Jesuits, or the disciples of Jesuits. Jesuits were their directors,
their confessors, and their governors. &#8220;I never yet knew
a treason without a Romish priest,&#8221; said Sir Edward Coke,
at the trial of the conspirators; and on Garnet&#8217;s trial he
declares, &#8220;Since the Jesuits set foot in this land, there
never passed four years without a most pestilent and pernicious
treason, tending to the subversion of the whole state.&#8221;
Shortly before the death of Elizabeth, and while the negotiations
just mentioned were going forward in Spain, the
pope, Clement VIII., addressed to the English Romanists
the bulls to which I have already referred in a former
chapter; by which they were instructed to oppose any one
who should claim the crown after Elizabeth&#8217;s death, unless
he would promise not merely to tolerate the Roman Catholic
faith, but to promote it by all means in his power. These
bulls were to be executed, &#8220;<i>Quandocunque contingeret
miseram illam f&#339;minam ex hac vit&acirc; excedere</i>,&#8221;&mdash;whenever
it should happen that that miserable woman should depart
this life. On James&#8217;s accession, therefore, many of the Romanists
were tampered with by the Jesuits, and persuaded
not to render obedience to his majesty, as being a heretic.
They were told by the Jesuits that they ought even to submit
to death rather than obey a heretic. King James was, however,
quietly seated on the throne, notwithstanding the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>secret practices of the Jesuits, backed as they were by the
king of Spain and the pope. As it was dangerous to keep
the two bulls in his possession, Garnet committed them to
the flames after James&#8217;s accession. Now it is altogether
manifest, that the treason originated in these bulls of Pope
Clement VIII.; for the conspirators argued, when the lawfulness
of the undertaking was discussed, that if it was lawful
to prevent James from possessing the throne, it was
equally so to remove him though he had taken possession.
I see not how this argument can be overturned by the
Romanists; or how they can clear the rulers of their church
of that day of the guilt of that dark transaction.</p>

<p>The circumstances of the country, therefore, at the time
of James&#8217;s accession were very peculiar. The pope had issued
his bulls to prevent any but a papist from succeeding
Queen Elizabeth; the king of Spain had promised assistance
to the English Romanists; and Garnet, with some other
Jesuits, and Catesby and his companions, were resolved to
execute the designs of his holiness. It was under such circumstances
that the plot was contrived. The king of
Spain, however, refused to contribute money or to send
troops when he heard of James&#8217;s accession, with whom he
wished to enter into a peace, and to whom he sent commissioners
for that purpose. The disappointment of their
hopes in obtaining assistance from Spain, led the conspirators,
Catesby, and his brethren, to devise some other
means, by which their object might be obtained. Frequent
meetings took place; and various plans were considered
and then relinquished. At length it was determined
to undermine the parliament house, and destroy
the king by means of gunpowder. It appears that Thomas
Winter had some misgivings, lest the church of Rome
should suffer in the estimation of the public if the plot
should be defeated. Catesby replied, that the nature
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>of the disease required a very sharp remedy. Winter&#8217;s
scruples were removed, and he entered into the project with
all his energies. Still Winter started difficulties, which
Catesby was most expert at removing. He objected the
difficulty of procuring a place, from which they might commence
their labours for the mine; but Catesby encouraged
him by proposing to make the attempt, and that, if it failed,
they might desist from any thing of the kind afterwards.</p>

<p>It seems that Catesby conceived the plan during the
spring, <small>A.D.</small> 1603. Thomas Winter states that he was
requested to meet him in town; where, after receiving a
second letter, he found him with John Wright. At this
meeting they conversed on the necessity incumbent on
them of doing something for the cause of their religion and
country; for these men, forsooth, professed to be patriots.
Winter expressed his readiness to hazard his life in the
cause; and Catesby made known his project. Thomas
Winter then went to the Continent to meet Fawkes, to whom
he was to make known the fact, that a plot was in agitation.
They met and returned to England the following spring,
when they were joined by Catesby, Percy, and Wright.
At one of these meetings Percy came into the room and
said, &#8220;Shall we always, gentlemen, talk, and never do any
thing?&#8221; Catesby took Percy aside for a few minutes.
Percy proposed to kill the king; but Catesby said, &#8220;<i>No,
Tom</i>, thou shalt not adventure thy life to so small a purpose.&#8221;
At this time the plan was partially concocted by
Catesby, but was revealed only to Winter. Catesby and
Winter agreed that an oath of secresy should be administered
before the plot was fully disclosed to their companions;
who, though they were all anxious to enter upon any project,
however desperate, were not yet acquainted with the
plan which had been devised by Catesby.</p>

<p>Though Winter and Fawkes had met on the Continent,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>and had travelled together to England, yet it does not appear
that the latter was made at that time acquainted with the
treason. He came to England with Winter, with a view to
the contrivance of a plot, but with the particular scheme projected
by Catesby he was not acquainted, until after his
return from the Continent. He was a reckless character,
and ready to join in any desperate enterprise. Fawkes, in
his own confession, declares, that the matter was at first
broken to him in a general way by Winter. The parties
were now five in number, namely, Catesby, Fawkes, Percy,
Thomas Winter, and John Wright. According to agreement
they all met together in a room near St. Clement&#8217;s
church, in the Strand. Here they administered an oath of
secresy to each other on a Primer. When the oath had
been taken, they all went into the next room, in which was
the Jesuit Gerard, from whom, after they had heard mass,
they received the sacrament. Gerard was probably acquainted
with all the particulars of the plot. He was aware
of the designs and intentions of the conspirators; for he
waited in the room for the express purpose of uniting them
together into a common bond for treasonable purposes. As
soon as these ceremonies had been passed through, Catesby
and Winter unfolded to the rest the plan which had been
devised; and observed that the oath had been taken, in
order that the plot might be concealed. Fawkes and the
rest fully approved of all that had been done, entering into
the plot with the utmost alacrity. In the spring of 1604,
therefore, the plot was concocted. The oath was couched
in the following terms:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;You shall swear by the blessed Trinity, and by the
sacrament you now purpose to receive, never to disclose,
directly nor indirectly, by word or circumstance, the matter
that shall be proposed to you to keep secret, nor desist from
the execution thereof until the rest shall give you leave.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>The next point was to secure a house near the House of
Lords, in which the mine might be commenced. Fortune,
in this respect, appeared to favour them, for during Winter&#8217;s
absence on the Continent, Catesby had heard that a particular
house adjoining the House of Lords might probably be
secured. Inquiries were made on the subject, when it was
discovered to be in the occupation of a person named Ferris,
who rented it of one of the officers of the House of Lords, by
whom some of the rooms were occasionally used for parliamentary
business. Percy was despatched by Catesby on
the business, and, after some difficulty, he succeeded in
becoming tenant to Winyard, the officer, as Ferris had previously
been. Fawkes assumed the character of Percy&#8217;s
servant, the keys of the house being committed to his keeping.
The name under which he now went was Johnson.
They also hired another house, in Lambeth, for the purpose
of stowing away the gunpowder and the wood, previous to
its being deposited in the mine. The house was one in
which Catesby often lodged. Their object, in depositing
their materials on that side of the river, was to avoid detection,
for they were fearful lest, by constantly entering the
house in Westminster, the suspicion of some of the inhabitants
might be awakened. It was at this period that Keys
was admitted into the secret, and to him was committed the
charge of the house in Lambeth. During these proceedings
the parliament was adjourned to the ensuing February,
an event which afforded abundance of time for their project;
and therefore they agreed to quit London for a season,
intending to return sufficiently early for the completion of
the work before the opening of the session. The conspirators
departed in different directions, in order to avoid suspicion.
It was about a month before the commencement of
Michaelmas term that the parties quitted London. About
the beginning of the term, Fawkes and Winter met Catesby.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>They all agreed that it was time to commence their operations.
When the parties arrived in London, they were
rather staggered by the discovery, that the Scottish lords
were appointed to assemble in Percy&#8217;s house, to discuss the
question of the union of the two kingdoms. In consequence
of this occupancy, they were not able to begin the mine
until the 11th of December, 1604. Late at night they entered
upon the work of darkness! The powder had already
been procured from Flanders, and deposited in the house at
Lambeth. Not only did they provide themselves with the
necessary tools for excavation, but they took in with them
a stock of provisions, consisting of biscuits and baked meats,
so that they might not be under the necessity of sending
out to the adjoining shops for provisions, and thereby excite
suspicion.</p>

<p>Now it must be remembered, that these conspirators
were quite unaccustomed to laborious employments: yet
their mistaken zeal in the cause of popery, which they seem
to have regarded as the truth, induced them to apply themselves
to the task with unceasing energy. They continued
at their labour from the 11th of December until Christmas
eve, without any intermission. Nor did they appear
in the streets until that day. At this time they had
conducted the mine under an entry close to the wall of the
parliament house, under-propping the earth, as they proceeded,
with wood. Fawkes, as being the least known of
the party, acted as sentinel to give the alarm in the event
of danger. In his own confession, Fawkes acknowledges,
&#8220;I stood as sentinel, to descrie any man that came near,
whereof I gave them warning, and so they ceased until
I gave notice again to proceed.&#8221; The object in placing
Fawkes as sentinel was this, namely, that they might cease
from their labour as any one approached, lest the noise
should be heard and a discovery ensue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>Winter, whose confession was very full and minute,
informs us that, during the progress of the work, they held
many conversations relative to the steps to be taken after the
execution of the deed. They hoped that the king and the
assembled lords would fall a sacrifice in the explosion: but
then there were the prince of Wales and the duke of York,
and how were they to be despatched? It was supposed
that the prince might attend the king, and share in the
same fate: and Percy, who all along had evinced great
boldness, undertook to secure the duke. Percy held an
office near the court, and was acquainted with several of
those who were employed in the royal household. He,
therefore, undertook to enter the chamber, after the blow
was struck, and, having placed others at the doors, to secure
the young prince. It was also determined that the king&#8217;s
daughter Elizabeth, who subsequently became queen of
Bohemia, and from whom the house of Hanover is descended,
she being the mother of the Princess Sophia, and
grandmother of George I., should be secured by some of
their party in the country. The princess was, at this time,
with Lord Harrington, in the county of Warwick, not very
distant from Catesby&#8217;s house. It was arranged, therefore,
that the Roman Catholics of that neighbourhood should
assemble, under the pretence of a hunting-match upon
Dunsmore Heath, and that the princess should be seized
during the confusion that would be consequent on the discovery
of the plot.</p>

<p>Money and horses were also necessary: and the conspirators,
at this stage of their proceedings, did not neglect to
make provision respecting both. These and other subjects
were discussed in the intervals of relaxation from their
laborious employment in the mine.</p>

<p>Another very important topic was also introduced during
these secret conversations: it related to the lords whom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>they should endeavour to save from the general destruction.
It was determined that they should prevent as many
of the Roman Catholic lords as possible from attending the
house on that occasion; but that the rest must necessarily
perish with the great body of the peers.</p>

<p>It was also debated whether they should reveal the project
to any foreign princes. A difficulty here stared them
in the face, namely, that they could not enjoin secresy by a
solemn oath, as they had done among themselves: nor were
they certain that the continental princes would approve of
their design. They had little hope from Spain, because the
king was too slow in his preparations, and was ready to
enter into negotiations with James: France was too near,
and could not safely be trusted. Such were their views of
France and Spain.</p>

<p>These discussions took place while they were engaged
in the mine. At this period parliament was again adjourned
until the <i>Fifth</i> of October; on which account the conspirators
ceased from their operations, intending to commence
their labours sufficiently early to enable them to bring the
matter to a completion, previous to the period fixed for the
opening of the session. Early in the ensuing spring, they
removed the powder which had been stowed in the house at
Lambeth, into Percy&#8217;s residence. Their labours were now
resumed with redoubled energy. The foundation wall of
the House of Lords was nine feet thick, so that their
progress was necessarily very slow. They were obliged to
chisel out the stones and the mortar; the wall being exceedingly
hard, they advanced only about a foot in a week.
These labours were continued during a fortnight, when they
deemed it necessary to admit some others into their secret,
to share with them in their toils. It was at this period
that Christopher Wright and Robert Winter were admitted
into their party. The same process was adopted in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>admission of these men as had been resorted to in the first
instance: they were sworn to secresy, and the oath was
confirmed by receiving the sacrament. With this accession
to their strength, they continued in the mine until Easter,
at which time they had advanced about half way through
the stone wall. While occupied in their work, they were
one day suddenly alarmed by a noise, which seemed to proceed
from no distant spot. The conspirators had provided
themselves with weapons, intending, if they were discovered,
to sell their lives as dearly as possible. These weapons
were now grasped by the whole party; and Fawkes was sent
out in order to discover the cause of the noise. He soon
returned to his companions, whose fears were banished by
his report. Fawkes discovered that the sound proceeded
from a cellar, which had been used for coals, and which was
under the House of Lords. The coals were now selling off,
the person who had rented the cellar being about to quit;
and the noise, which had alarmed them, was occasioned by
the falling down and the removal of these coals. This cellar
was most convenient for their purpose: for it was exactly
under the throne. The grand object, therefore, was now
to secure it. Fawkes soon ascertained that it was to be let.
Percy immediately hired it, pretending that he wished to
use it as a coal cellar for his adjoining house.</p>

<p>Thus far they appeared to prosper in their dark enterprise.
The mine was now relinquished; and it was resolved
to deposit the powder in the cellar. Their labours were
discontinued; and all their energies were exerted in making
arrangements to secure the success of their design<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>Hitherto Catesby had himself borne the expenses of the
treasonable undertaking; but his resources were insufficient
for the charge of maintaining the party, for the rent of several
houses, and for the purchase of the materials with which
the scheme was to be carried into effect. It was deemed
necessary, therefore, that some monied person or persons
should be made acquainted with the design, in order that
pecuniary aid might be procured: and Catesby proposed
that he and Percy, and another of the conspirators,
should be permitted to disclose their secret to such persons
as they, in their discretion, might deem desirable. The
proposition was agreed to by the whole party, who now
amounted to seven in number. This plan was adopted,
because the parties thought, that several of the wealthy
Romanists would be willing to contribute pecuniary aid,
though they might be unwilling to disclose their names to
the whole number of the conspirators. Having made this
arrangement, Fawkes was employed in depositing a large
quantity of powder and wood in the cellar which had recently
been taken. The house was cleared of all those things
which might have awakened suspicion, while everything
was placed in the cellar,&mdash;a place which no one visited.</p>

<p>They began now to contemplate making another trial of
their friends on the Continent. Catesby proposed that
Fawkes should go over, assigning two reasons for his absence;
<i>first</i>, that he might not be seen in England for a time; and
<i>secondly</i>, that he might acquaint Sir William Stanley and
Mr. Owen with their proceedings. It was, however, determined
that the same oath of secresy should be administered
to these two gentlemen.</p>

<p>Fawkes quitted England about Easter. Stanley was
absent from Brussels, to which place Fawkes had repaired;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>but he made the matter known to Owen, who cordially
entered into the project. In the month of August, Fawkes
again returned to England.</p>

<p>About the same time, Catesby and Percy met in the
city of Bath, for the purpose of calling in others to render
pecuniary assistance agreeably to their previous determination.
It was at this stage of the plot, that Sir Everard
Digby and Francis Tresham were made acquainted with the
design. Neither of these gentlemen scrupled to enter into
the plot. It was a most extraordinary thing, that gentlemen,
otherwise of strict integrity, should have been so
influenced by their religious views, as to concur in such a
design without hesitation, which seems to have been the
case. Sir Everard Digby engaged to furnish 1500<i>l.</i>, and
Mr. Tresham 2000<i>l.</i>, towards the accomplishment of the
object. Percy also promised to obtain as large a sum as
possible from the rents of the earl of Northumberland.
Rookwood and Grant were made acquainted with the plot
about the same time; so that the number of the conspirators
was now completed. These gentlemen, however, never
entered the mine: they were merely privy to the treason,
and promoted it by rendering pecuniary assistance.</p>

<p>When these matters were arranged between Catesby,
Percy, and Tresham, Fawkes and Thomas Winter procured
some fresh powder, and placed it in the cellar, as they intended
it should stand for the explosion. All things being
thus arranged by the conspirators, the parliament was
again prorogued until the <i>Fifth</i> of November; an event
which dispersed the party for a time. This third prorogation
alarmed the conspirators, who imagined that their
plot was discovered. To ascertain whether their suspicions
were well founded, they mingled with the crowd
on the day of prorogation, in order that they might watch
the proceedings of the commissioners. They were satisfied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>that their suspicions were groundless; so that they
went into the country in high spirits. About ten days
previous to the <i>Fifth</i> of November, Catesby and Fawkes
returned to the neighbourhood of London. Several of
the traitors met together at <i>White Webbs</i>, on <i>Enfield
Chase</i>. At this time, they were informed, that the prince
of Wales would not be present at the opening of parliament.
Whereupon, they determined on seizing him after
the explosion. The duke of York, afterwards Charles I.,
was so safely guarded, that they entertained but slight hopes
of getting him into their power. Down to the end of
October, therefore, all things seemed to favour the designs
of the conspirators, while the intended victims were unconscious
of the danger to which they were exposed. Still the
watchful eye of Divine providence was fixed upon the king
and the peers; and the schemes of the traitors, secretly as
they were carried on, were revealed, by one of those remarkable
events, which no human understanding can fathom.
The remark of Fuller on the frequent prorogation of parliament
deserves attention: &#8220;As if Divine providence had
given warning to these traitors (by the slow proceedings,
and oft adjourning of the parliament), mean time seriously
to consider, what they went about, and seasonably to desist
from so damnable a design, as suspicious at last it would
be ruined, which so long had been retarded. But, no
<i>taking off their wheels</i> will stay those <i>chariots</i> from drowning,
which God hath decreed shall be swallowed in the <i>Red
Sea</i><a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>.&#8221;</p>

<p>I have now brought the narrative down to the latter end
of October, 1605. The conspirators were in and near
London, Fawkes alone, as the individual who was to fire the
train, taking his post in the cellar, or the adjoining house,
as Catesby&#8217;s servant. The parties were very cautious in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>all their proceedings, so that they met together secretly,
whenever a meeting was necessary. As the powder and
the wood were deposited in the cellar, and nothing remained
to be done in London, the conspirators hovered
near, leaving Fawkes to manage the firing of the train.
They were full of sanguine expectations respecting the
event, and busied themselves at this period, in forming
plans for securing the young princes, and for carrying their
ulterior designs into execution. Their attempt was, however,
frustrated by an overruling providence!</p>

<p class="summary long">THE JESUITS PRIVY TO THE PLOT. THE NARRATIVE
CONTINUED DOWN TO THE PERIOD OF THE DISCOVERY
OF THE TREASON.</p>


<p class="newsection"><span class="smcap">Before</span> the narrative is carried further, it will be desirable
to allude to those clerical individuals who were privy to this
conspiracy. The actors were, as has been seen, laymen;
but there were some priests of the church of Rome, and
members of the order of Jesuits, who were no less implicated
in the design than those who actually worked in the
mine. Garnet, Gerard, and Tesmond, were Englishmen
by birth; and yet, for the sake of advancing the interests
of the church of Rome, they hesitated not to enter into the
plot. Garnet was evidently a man of considerable attainments;
nor is there any reason to believe that he was not,
in many respects, an amiable man. His principles however,
were such, that he could without scruple enter into a conspiracy
against his sovereign and his country. There is
reason to believe that he was privy to the design from the
commencement, if he did not even suggest it to Catesby.
At all events these Jesuits were made acquainted with all
the proceedings of the conspirators, whom they aided and
encouraged in their work, by such counsel as the church of
Rome is accustomed to impart to her deluded votaries.</p>

<p>Even Catesby at one time had his scruples. He was
not satisfied that it was right to sacrifice several Roman
Catholic peers, who would be present at the opening of the
session. His scruples were submitted to Garnet. It
is, however, more than probable, that Catesby applied
to Garnet, in order that he might be able to remove the
scruples of others, should any arise. A case, therefore,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>was proposed, and to the following effect: &#8220;Whether, for the
good of the church against heretics, it would be lawful,
amongst many innocents, to destroy some innocents?&#8221; Garnet
replied, that, if the advantage to the church would be
greater, by taking away some of the Roman Catholic lords,
together with many of their enemies, it would be lawful to
destroy them all. &#8220;Indeed,&#8221; says Fuller, &#8220;the good husbandman
in the Gospel, permitted the <i>tares</i> to grow for the
corne&#8217;s sake; whereas here, by the contrary counsel of the
<i>Jesuit</i>, the corn (so they reputed it,) was to be rooted up for
the tares&#8217; sake<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>.&#8221; He gave also an illustration from the case
of a besieged town, which must be subjected to the horrors
of war, even though some friends of the besiegers are dwelling
within its walls. It was this determination of Garnet&#8217;s,
that quieted the doubts of the whole party throughout the
proceedings. Rookwood was staggered, when the matter
was first proposed to him; but he was satisfied when
Catesby mentioned Garnet&#8217;s decision.</p>

<p>The Jesuit wished to obtain the formal consent of the
pope; but Catesby argued that it had been already granted,
in the two bulls, the object of which was to prevent James
from succeeding to the throne. Keys was induced to enter
into the plot by these arguments; while Bates, Catesby&#8217;s
servant, was assured by another Jesuit, not only that he
might lawfully conceal, but actually participate in the
treason.</p>

<p>It has been already stated, that Bates confessed to Tesmond.
In the church of Rome, confession precedes the
sacrament; and in confession, Bates revealed all the particulars
of the plot; still he was encouraged in the treason by
his ghostly counsellor. In short, the evidence of the participation
of the Jesuits in the plot is of such a description,
that it cannot be disputed by any one who examines it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>The narrative has already been brought down to the
autumn of 1605, when the parliament was prorogued from
October to November the 5th. On Saturday evening,
October 26, ten days previous to the day fixed for the
opening of parliament, a letter, addressed to Lord Monteagle,
was delivered, by a person unknown, to his lordship&#8217;s
footman, in the street, with a strict injunction to deliver it
into his master&#8217;s own hands. This circumstance took place
at seven o&#8217;clock, just as the nobleman was about to sit
down to supper. The letter was put into his lordship&#8217;s
hand by the servant. On opening it, he found it written in
a very illegible hand, and without date or subscription.
Monteagle summoned one of his attendants, to assist him
in deciphering the epistle, which was couched in the following
terms:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;My lord,</p>

<p>&#8220;Out of the love I bear to some of your friends, I
have a care of your preservation; therefore, I would advise
you, as you tender your life, to devise some excuse to shift
off your attendance at this parliament; for God and man
have concurred to punish the wickedness of this time. And
think not slightly of this advertisement, but retire yourself
into your country, where you may expect the event in
safety. For though there be no appearance of any stir,
<i>yet I say they shall receive a terrible blow this parliament,
and yet they shall not see who hurts them</i>. This council
is not to be contemned, because it may do you good, and
can do you no harm; <i>for the danger is past, as soon as you
have burnt the letter</i>: and I hope God will give you the
grace to make a good use of it, to whose holy protection I
commend you<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>.&#8221;</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>Dark, indeed, were the words. In the first instance,
Monteagle viewed the matter as a <i>hoax</i>, intended to prevent
him from attending the opening of the session. Still
he deemed it the safest course not to conceal its contents.
Accordingly he hastened off to Whitehall at that late hour,
when, too, the streets of London were not lighted as
they are in our day, and submitted the letter to the earl of
Salisbury, Cecil, one of the secretaries of state. It does not
appear that Cecil laid much stress upon the letter; at the
same time he expressed an opinion, that it might refer to
some design of the papists, respecting which he had received
some information from various quarters. His information,
however, did not relate to any plot; but merely to an attempt,
on the part of the Romanists, at the commencement
of the session, to obtain a toleration for their worship, and
the relaxation of some of the penal laws.</p>

<p>Various attempts have been made to shift the odium of
the conspiracy from the church of Rome, and also from any
members of that church. Some Roman Catholic writers
have not scrupled to say, that the whole was a trick of
Cecil&#8217;s, and that King James was privy to the design, which
was entered upon by the court, for the purpose of rendering
the Romanists odious, and to pave the way for more stringent
laws against recusants.</p>

<p>The assertion that the whole plot was a trick of Cecil&#8217;s,
intended to render the Romanists odious to their countrymen,
was not advanced till sixty years after the event. No
one at the time questioned the reality of the conspiracy.
The confessions of the parties, and the secret letters of
Sir Everard Digby, preclude the possibility of even entertaining
such an absurd notion. Not one of the conspirators
complained of being deceived into the plot, either at his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>trial or execution; nor did any of their apologists deny the
fact of the treason. The assertion was worthy of that
church from whom it proceeded. Mr. Hallam, a most unexceptionable
witness, thus argues on this point: &#8220;But to
deny that there was such a plot, or, which is the same thing,
to throw the whole on the contrivance and management of
Cecil, as has sometimes been done, argues great effrontery
in those who lead, and great stupidity in those who follow.
The letter to Monteagle, the discovery of the powder, the
simultaneous rising in arms in Warwickshire,&mdash;are as indisputable
as any facts in history. What, then, had Cecil to
do with the plot, except that he hit upon the clue to the
dark allusions in the letter to Monteagle, of which he was
courtier enough to let the king take the credit? James&#8217;s
admirers have always reckoned this, as he did himself, a
vast proof of sagacity: yet there seems no great acuteness
in the discovery, even if it had been his own. He might
have recollected the circumstances of his father&#8217;s catastrophe,
which would naturally put him on the scent of gunpowder<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>.&#8221;</p>

<p>In recent times, however, it has been the policy of
Roman Catholic writers to represent the conspiracy as the
act of a few desperate characters. Desperate, indeed, they
were; yet they were not men of desperate fortunes; nor had
they suffered under the execution of the laws; but the sole
principle that influenced them was one of religion. They
were willing to risk all for the sake of promoting the interests
of the church of Rome. It will also be seen hereafter
that the pope, and some papal sovereigns, approved of the
deed.</p>

<p>As to the report that the court were aware of the design
long before the search, which was made in consequence of
the letter, it is as destitute of foundation as the other. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>court knew that some design was on foot: nor were they
surprised, since such had been the case throughout the
reign of Elizabeth; and the court was still composed of the
same great statesmen. As to any knowledge of this particular
plot, the court were not in possession of it. The king
of France had informed the ministers that some secret
plot was going on; but beyond this information the court
had no knowledge on the subject. The secular priests,
also, who were protected by Bancroft, intimated that some
dark plot was concocting; but they were as ignorant of the
particulars as the ministers. All the information, which
James and his ministers received from the Continent,
amounted merely to an assurance that a treason was hatching;
but respecting the traitors and their proceedings they
could learn nothing. These intimations undoubtedly rendered
Cecil and James suspicious of the letter to Monteagle;
but the letter conveyed the first certain intelligence
that the danger was so near and so imminent.</p>

<p>When Cecil had read the letter, he laid it before the
lord chamberlain and the earls of Worcester and Northampton.
Monteagle was anxious that it should receive
every consideration. They immediately connected the letter
with the intelligence respecting the designs of the papists,
of which they had been previously warned. It was determined,
therefore, to submit the letter to the king, and not
to take any steps in the business until they had obtained
his majesty&#8217;s orders.</p>

<p>On Thursday, October 31st, the king returned from
Royston; and the next day Cecil submitted the letter to his
inspection. It appears that Cecil offered no opinion concerning
the letter; he merely placed it in his majesty&#8217;s
hands. After a little pause, the king expressed an opinion
that it ought not to be despised. Cecil, perceiving that the
king viewed the matter more seriously than he had anticipated,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>referred him to one sentence, <i>&#8220;for the danger is past
as soon as you have burnt the letter,&#8221;</i> which he conceived
must have been written by a fool or a madman, since if the
danger was past as soon as the letter was destroyed, as if
burning the letter could ward off the danger, the warning
was of small consequence. The king connected the expression
with the former sentence, <i>&#8220;That they should receive a
terrible blow at this parliament, and yet should not see who
hurt them.&#8221;</i> Taking the two sentences together, the king
immediately fancied that there was an allusion to some attempt
by gunpowder. An insurrection, or any other attempt,
during the sitting of parliament, could not be unseen; could
not be momentarily executed. The king interpreted the
clause thus, that the danger would be sudden and as quickly
over as the burning of the paper in the fire, taking the
words <i>as soon</i> in the sense of <i>as quickly</i>. He suggested,
therefore, that the letter must refer to an explosion of
gunpowder, and that the spot chosen for it must be under
or near the House of Lords.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that Cecil himself had intimated to
some of his colleagues, before the king&#8217;s return from
Royston, that the letter must refer to an explosion of gunpowder:
the very same suspicion also crossed the mind of
the earl of Suffolk, the lord chamberlain. This suspicion,
however, was concealed from the king by the two
statesmen. His majesty instantly took the same view of the
letter, though he was totally unacquainted with the opinions
of his two councillors. Popish authors have laboured to
prove, that the treason was either planned by, or at least
known to, the court, because the king so readily referred
the letter to an explosion by gunpowder. Cecil and Suffolk
had conceived the same opinion, though it does not appear
that they thought of gunpowder secreted under the House of
Lords. But what proof does this circumstance furnish of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>any previous knowledge even, on the part of the court,
much less of contrivance? Was it strange that they should
thus interpret such a mysterious letter? Cecil and Suffolk
were fully aware of the plots which had been devised
against Elizabeth; they knew that on more than one occasion,
the traitors had contemplated the death of the queen
by means of gunpowder. With these facts fresh in their
recollection, it was perfectly natural to interpret the letter
to signify some attempt of the same kind. In short, no
other interpretation could have reasonably been put upon
it. That the king himself should have suspected some
attempt by means of gunpowder was also to be expected.
He was well aware of the practices of the church of Rome;
and it is probable that, on this occasion, he recollected the
fate of his father, King Henry, whose death was accomplished
by an explosion of gunpowder. To King James,
therefore, really belongs the honour of discovering the
gunpowder treason; for, though Cecil and Suffolk had
conceived the same idea, yet they do not appear to have
entertained the notion of a mine under the House of
Lords. Besides, the two lords did not communicate their
suspicions to the king. The remarkable part of the business,
therefore, is the fact, that the three individuals should
have so readily struck upon the same idea. It must, however,
be stated that the interpretation put by the king upon
the clause relative to the burning of the letter was not the
true one: for it is pretty clear, that the writer wished
Monteagle to absent himself from the parliament, and to
burn the letter to avoid suspicion of being privy to the
plot. But, though we may admit, that the king&#8217;s interpretation
of the clause was not that, which the writer intended,
yet we must acknowledge, that his majesty&#8217;s suggestion
was most providential, and sufficient to justify the
strong language used in the Act of Parliament for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>observance of the Fifth of November. Let it be remembered
that timidity was one of James&#8217;s infirmities; and fear
is usually very quick-sighted.</p>

<p>At this first interview with the king, no plan was
adopted for their further course. The king suggested a
search; but Cecil did not give his sanction. It appears to
have been his aim to delay the search a little longer; and,
therefore, he quitted the royal presence with a jest. What
his motives were for not complying with the king&#8217;s suggestion,
cannot be ascertained. In all probability he was anxious
to consult his colleagues, or he may have thought that the
king&#8217;s apprehensions relative to the concealment of gunpowder
under the House of Lords were groundless. He
did not, however, think lightly of the matter, though he
jested with his majesty; for he immediately laid the whole
case before the lords, with whom he had previously consulted,
telling them what the king had said and suggested.
It was agreed that Cecil should wait on the king the next
day. The next day, accordingly, being Saturday, he introduced
the subject again to the notice of his majesty. At
this interview the lord chancellor was also present. It was
now determined, that the lord chamberlain, by virtue of
his office, should examine all the parts contiguous to the
House of Lords, and especially the lower offices, in order
that he might judge, from the appearances, which might
present themselves, whether there was a probability of any
such danger. To prevent the circulation of idle rumours,
as well as to allow the conspirators to carry their plans as
near to completion as possible, the examination was deferred
until the following Monday, November 4th, being the day
preceding that fixed for the opening of the session.</p>

<p>It has never been satisfactorily ascertained who was
the writer of the letter; but it is remarkable that the circumstance
was made known to the conspirators within a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>very brief space after its delivery to Lord Monteagle.
That one of the party penned it there can be no doubt;
for they had proceeded with so much secresy, that no other
person had any idea of such a design. By the interposition
of Providence one, who was anxious to save an individual
nobleman from death, brought destruction not only upon
himself, but also upon all his associates. Neither the
writer nor the bearer of the letter was ever known. It is
probable that the writer himself was the bearer, as it is
unlikely that the man who could pen it, and who felt so
much anxiety about the life of Lord Monteagle, would
commit it to the custody of another.</p>

<p>On Sunday evening, October 27th, the day after the
delivery of the letter, a person called on Thomas Winter,
and related the circumstance. This person was the servant
of Monteagle, who had been called in to assist in deciphering
the letter. Winter communicated the intelligence to
Catesby, and recommended instant flight; but the latter
was determined to ascertain the exact amount of information
which had been communicated to Monteagle, which
he hoped to discover by watching the movements of the
government agents near the Parliament House. Winter,
therefore, remained at White Webbs with Catesby, while
Fawkes was sent to London to watch the proceedings of
the court. Fawkes left them on Wednesday morning,
October 30th, and returned in the evening, with the gratifying
intelligence, that he found every thing in the cellar
just as he had left it. They now hoped that the letter was
disregarded, and that the danger of discovery was over.
On the Thursday, Winter returned to London; and on
Friday, he met Catesby and Tresham at Barnet. Tresham,
who was related to Monteagle&#8217;s wife, was suspected of being
the writer of the letter, and was questioned on the subject
by Catesby. He denied, however, that he had any knowledge
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>of the matter; and it appears from Winter&#8217;s confession
that his denial was believed by the other conspirators.
On Saturday, November 2nd, in the evening, Tresham and
Winter met again in Lincoln&#8217;s Inn Fields. On this occasion,
Tresham related several particulars of the interviews between
the king and Cecil. How he became acquainted
with these particulars does not appear. Both Catesby and
Winter deemed it necessary now to think of flight; but the
former would not take that step without seeing Percy, who
was not yet come up from the country. On Percy&#8217;s arrival
on the Sunday, he recommended that they should remain,
and await the issue.</p>

<p>All the conspirators were now in great perplexity. On
Monday, Nov. 4, Catesby went into the country, and Percy
to the seat of the earl of Northumberland. Fawkes remained
to fire the train, as had been previously arranged.
At this time, therefore, they were uncertain whether they
were discovered, or whether the treason was still unknown.</p>

<p>On Monday afternoon, agreeably to the previous arrangement,
the lord chamberlain, accompanied by Lord Monteagle,
and Whinyard, keeper of the wardrobe, proceeded to
examine the rooms under the House of Lords. They came
at last, to the vault or cellar, which had been taken by
Percy. Here they saw the coals and wood which had been
deposited there by the conspirators, to conceal the barrels
of gunpowder. The cellar was at the disposal of Whinyard:
and it appears to have been his privilege to let it for
his own profit. On being questioned by the lord chamberlain,
Whinyard replied, that he had let the cellar to Thomas
Percy, with the adjoining house, and that the wood and
coals were the property of that gentleman. At this stage
of the examination, the lord chamberlain saw a man standing
in a corner of the cellar, who stated that he was Percy&#8217;s
servant, and that he was left by his master in charge of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>house and cellar. This individual was Guy Fawkes, who
was appointed to fire the train. The lord chamberlain carelessly
remarked to Fawkes, that his master was well provided,
by his large stock of fuel, against the blasts of
winter. On leaving the cellar, Lord Monteagle intimated
his suspicion that Percy was the writer of the letter. This
suspicion entered his mind as soon as Percy&#8217;s name was
mentioned, recollecting the friendship that had subsisted
between them<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>.</p>

<p>The lord chamberlain returned immediately to the king,
to whom, with the council, he related all that he had seen,
mentioning also the suspicion of Lord Monteagle respecting
Percy. He expressed his surprise that so large a quantity
of fuel should be deposited in the cellar, when it was well
known, that the house was seldom occupied by Percy. It
appears, too, that he did not consider that the appearance
of Fawkes was much like that of a servant.</p>

<p>The king still insisted, that it was necessary to make a
rigid search, and that the wood and coals must be removed.
It occurred to him, that they were placed there to conceal
the gunpowder, for it was his majesty&#8217;s firm conviction, that
some such attempt was alluded to by the writer of the letter.
The members of the council who were then present, concurred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>also in the same opinion. Still, they were in doubt
as to the mode in which the search should be conducted.
They were, on the one hand, anxious for the safety of the
king&#8217;s person, and on the other, fearful lest, if nothing of
the kind should be discovered, they might be exposed to
ridicule for entertaining groundless fears, unbecoming in
statesmen and the ministers of the crown. It was suggested,
also, that if the search proved fruitless, the earl of Northumberland
might feel himself aggrieved, in consequence
of his relationship to Percy, the owner of the house. All
the members of the council agreed in the necessity of instituting
a search: but their opinions respecting the manner in
which it should be effected, widely differed. James insisted,
that they must necessarily adopt one of two courses; either
search the cellar narrowly, or leave the matter altogether,
and go to the House the next day, just as if no suspicion
had ever existed.</p>

<p>It was therefore determined at length, that a search
should be made; but to prevent any sinister report, supposing
nothing was discovered, it was ordered that Whinyard,
the keeper of the wardrobe, should search the cellar,
under the pretence of having lost some of the hangings,
which had been placed in his custody. The king also suggested
that the search should be conducted under the direction
of a magistrate. Accordingly, Sir Thomas Knivett, a
magistrate for Westminster, proceeded with a small and
chosen band, to the parliament house, at midnight; while
the king and his councillors remained at Whitehall. At
the entrance to the cellar, they discovered Fawkes standing
with his cloak and boots on, as if about to take a journey.
He had just made all his arrangements within, when the
magistrate and his party approached. Knivett apprehended
him immediately, and then the party proceeded to remove
some of the wood and coals. They soon came to a barrel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>of gunpowder: and in a short space, the whole number,
amounting to thirty-six, were discovered. The next step
was to search the prisoner Fawkes. They found on his
person matches, and all other things necessary for his purpose.
A dark lanthorn was discovered in a corner of
the cellar. Fawkes made great resistance, when the party
attempted to search his person; but as soon as he was
secured, he expressed his sorrow, that he had not been
able to fire the train, which he asserted he would have done,
if he had been within the cellar at the moment when he was
taken, instead of being at the door.</p>

<p>Besides the lanthorn and the matches, there was found
on the person of Fawkes, a <i>pocket watch</i>! At that time,
such a thing was very uncommon. He had procured this
watch in order that he might ascertain the exact hour for
firing the train. Such little incidental notices serve to show
the state of the arts and sciences at particular periods, with
their subsequent progress, better than the most laboured
treatises on the subject. At this time, we learn, that small
watches for the pocket were very uncommon; for the fact,
that such a watch was found on the person of Fawkes, is
mentioned as a rare circumstance. What a contrast between
that period and the present day! And yet, in many of the
fine arts, the age of James I. and Charles I. vastly excelled
our own. In the mechanical arts, however, it was greatly
inferior.</p>

<p>Sir Thomas Knivett, having secured Fawkes, returned
to Whitehall, about four o&#8217;clock on the morning of Tuesday,
the Fifth of November, so that the discovery took place
exactly twelve hours before the time, when the train would
have been fired, if the parliament had assembled. The
magistrate communicated everything to the lord chamberlain,
who rushed without ceremony, into the king&#8217;s chamber,
exclaiming that all was discovered, that all was safe, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>that the traitor was secured. All the members of the
council, who were in London, were now summoned to attend.
Within a short space, Fawkes was placed before them, in
order that he might be examined respecting this unheard-of
treason. The prisoner appeared before them undaunted.
Neither the awful situation in which he stood, nor the numberless
questions which were put to him by those who stood
by, moved him in the least. He not only avowed his participation
in the treason, but regretted that he had not been
able to execute it. Alluding to the discovery, he remarked,
that the devil, not God, was the author of that discovery.
During the whole day, the council could extract nothing
from him by their examinations. He took all the blame
upon himself, refusing to name any of his accomplices, but
acknowledging that he was induced to enter upon the
treason, from religious motives alone. He denied that the
king was his lawful sovereign, inasmuch as he was a heretic.
At this time, he refused to disclose his true name, calling
himself <i>John Johnson</i>, servant to <i>Thomas Percy</i>. In a
few days, however, being in a prison, he made a full confession
of his guilt. Thus was discovered, one of the
darkest treasons with which our annals are stained. Divine
Providence interposed, just at the moment when the conspirators
believed that their expectations were about to be
realized. The merit of the discovery must certainly be attributed
to the king. For though it is clear that the letter
evidently pointed to something of the sort; yet before the
treason was discovered, most of those to whom it was submitted,
were in much doubt as to its meaning. The king
alone suggested, that the vaults under the House should be
searched: and in such a case, who can deny, that the
thought in the king&#8217;s mind was suggested by a higher
power? &#8220;Let King James,&#8221; says Fuller, &#8220;by reading the
letter, have the credit of discovering this plot to the world,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>and God the glory, for discovering it unto King James.&#8221;
Wilson&#8217;s words are much to the same effect; &#8220;being discovered
by a light from heaven, and a letter from one of
the conspirators, when the fire was already in their hands,
as well as raged in their hearts, to put to the train.&#8221;</p>

<p>Half an hour before the time, when it was expected that
the king would enter the house, Fawkes was to place a match
in such a position, that after burning during that space,
should fire the train. He was to set sail for Flanders, for the
purpose of obtaining succours from foreign princes; and
the rest of the conspirators were to manage matters at
home. It is said that those Jesuits who were privy to the
design, but who could not publicly appear, were appointed
to meet on a certain spot, on Hampstead Hill, that they
might behold the conflagration caused by the explosion.
This spot is still designated <i>Traitors&#8217; Hill</i>.</p>

<p>There is, indeed, a story, which would lead to the
belief, that Fawkes was to have been sacrificed by his
brethren in crime. I give the story, as it is recorded in
the histories of the period, without pledging myself to its
truth. At Tickmarsh, in Northamptonshire, resided a Mr.
Pickering, who had a horse remarkable for its speed;
Keys, one of the conspirators, is said to have borrowed this
horse, shortly before the period fixed for the opening of the
session. Fawkes, after having fired the train, was to proceed
to St. George&#8217;s Fields, where he would find the horse
in question, on which he was to make his escape. This
was the impression on Fawkes&#8217;s own mind. It was further
arranged, that Mr. Pickering, who was a well known puritan,
should that morning be murdered in his bed, and
secretly conveyed away; and that Fawkes also should be
murdered in St. George&#8217;s Fields, and so mangled, as not to
be recognized by any one. A report was then to be circulated,
that the puritans had perpetrated the atrocious deed;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>and to give some colour to this report, the conspirators were
to appeal to the fact, that Mr. Pickering, with his swift
horse, was there ready to escape; but that some persons
who saw him, in detestation of so horrible a deed, had
killed him on the spot, and hewed his body to pieces.
Thus the mangled body of Fawkes was to be taken for that
of Mr. Pickering, it being supposed that no one would doubt
the fact, from the circumstance of the horse being found
near the spot. It is added, that Fawkes, when he was convinced
that it was the intention of his companions to put
him to death, confessed the whole plot, which he would
not have done, but for this treachery on the part of his
fellow-conspirators. Such is the story, but I cannot vouch
for its truth<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>.</p>

<p>The fact, that the vaults and cellars under the House
of Lords were then let out to hire for such purposes, furnishes
a singular view of the manners of the age when contrasted
with those of our own times. It appears that the
inferior officers of the House made the most of their privileges.
At this stage of the discovery, the king and his
ministers were ignorant of the mine, which had been carried
along from Percy&#8217;s residence, under the walls of the House
of Lords. This was not known until some of the conspirators
had made a discovery of all their proceedings. Great
was the joy of the nation when it became known that such
a treason had been brought to light, and great was their
gratitude to that omniscient Being, by whose gracious interposition,
the dark designs of the conspirators were frustrated.</p>

<p class="summary long">THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE CONSPIRATORS ON THE DISCOVERY
OF THE PLOT&mdash;THEIR CAPTURE AT HOLBEACH&mdash;THE
MEETING OF PARLIAMENT.</p>


<p class="newsection"><span class="smcap">It</span> will now be necessary to look back a little on the movements
of the other conspirators. Fawkes remained to fire
the train and was secured, as is detailed in the last chapter.
On Tuesday morning, November 5th, as early as five o&#8217;clock,
one of the Wrights called on Thomas Winter, assuring
him that the whole plot was discovered. Wright stated,
that a nobleman had called on Lord Monteagle, bidding
him rise to accompany him to the earl of Northumberland&#8217;s,
where it was probably expected that Percy would be found.
This was only an hour after the return of the searching
party to Whitehall. Some of the conspirators were on the
watch in various parts of the town; and Wright chanced
to obtain the important information, which he communicated
to Winter. He heard the nobleman, who called
up Lord Monteagle, say, <i>The matter is discovered</i>. At
Winter&#8217;s request, Wright went back to Essex gate to learn
something further: in a short space he returned, adding, <i>All
is lost</i>. He found a man on horseback at Essex door, who
immediately rode at full gallop up Fleet Street. Winter
was conscious that they were seeking for Percy; and he
requested Wright to make him acquainted with all that had
taken place, in order that he might effect his escape.
Winter then quitted his lodging, being determined to ascertain
the worst. He went first to the court gates, which
were so guarded that no one could enter: he proceeded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>onward towards the parliament house, but was prevented
from passing by the guard, which was posted in King
Street. As he came back he heard a person in the street
observe to another, that a treason was just discovered, in
which the king and the lords were to have been blown up
by gunpowder. Winter was now convinced that all was
discovered, and therefore he rode off into the country.
The two Wrights appear to have quitted London at the
same time.</p>

<p>Catesby, the leader of the conspirators, had left London
the preceding evening, in order that he might be prepared
to execute their project relative to the Princess Elizabeth
as soon as the blow should be struck. Percy also had departed
from London that morning as early as four o&#8217;clock,
probably from having received some information respecting
the discovery. They made the best of their way into
Warwickshire, where they had previously agreed to meet.</p>

<p>London was all in commotion as the day dawned: the
streets were thronged with spectators, all eagerly inquiring
what had taken place during the night. It was soon ascertained,
that a conspiracy had been providentially discovered,
and that one of the traitors was already in custody. The
satisfaction of the people was great at the intelligence, that
no danger now existed, and that the king and the parliament
were safe.</p>

<p>Fawkes was kept strictly guarded; and in a few days
made a confession of the principal circumstances of the
conspiracy.</p>

<p>The conspirators who had quitted London, previous to
the fifth of November, proceeded to the place of meeting
in Warwickshire. On Wednesday morning Grant and certain
others seized upon some horses, which had been
placed under the care of a riding-master. These horses
were to be used at the <i>hunting match</i> appointed by Digby.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>Their object was to assemble large numbers of people under
the pretence of <i>hunting</i>, and then seize upon the Princess
Elizabeth. Having the princess in their possession, they
hoped to be able to succeed in effecting a complete change
in the government of the country. Had the plot succeeded
in London, most of the Papists would have joined them.
On Wednesday evening the conspirators who resided in the
country, as well as those who had quitted London before
the discovery, met at Sir Everard Digby&#8217;s according to
their previous arrangement.</p>

<p>It was now known that the plot was discovered; for
those who had left London on Tuesday morning brought
with them the intelligence. The question now agitated
related to their future movements; and it was determined
to make an attempt at open rebellion. This attempt shows
the desperate character of the men; for they could not
reasonably indulge in the expectation of success. They
accordingly mustered as many forces as they were able,
intending to await the issue of an encounter with the civil
power, and hoping, amid the confusion consequent upon
the discovery of the treason, to induce many members of
the church of Rome to join them. In one of the letters of
Sir Everard Digby, referred to in a subsequent page, a
clear and succinct account of their intended movements is
given:&mdash;&#8220;If the design had taken place, there could have
been no doubt of other success; for that night, before any
other could have brought the news, we should have known
it by Mr. Catesby, who should have proclaimed the heir
apparent at Charing-cross as he came out of town: to which
purpose there was a proclamation drawn: if the duke had
not been in the House then, there was a certain way laid for
the possessing him; but in regard of the assurance, they
should have been there, therefore the greatest of our business
stood in the possessing the Lady Elizabeth, who lying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>within eight miles of Dunchurch, we would have easily surprised
before the knowledge of any doubt&mdash;this was the
cause of my being there.&#8221; They mustered to the number
of eighty persons only. From Warwickshire they passed
to the borders of Staffordshire. Sir Richard Verney, the
high sheriff of Warwickshire, pursued them. As they
rambled through the country, they seized upon such arms
and ammunition as fell in their way. On Friday, the 8th of
November, the conspirators reached the house of Stephen
Littleton, at Holbeach, in Staffordshire. The sheriff of
Worcestershire sent a trumpeter commanding them to surrender,
thinking that they were merely guilty of an ordinary
riot, for he had not yet heard of the conspiracy. In
those days intelligence was not so rapidly communicated,
from one part of the country to another, as in modern
times. The discovery took place on Tuesday morning
very early: and the assemblage at Littleton&#8217;s house was on
the Friday after; and yet the sheriff of Worcestershire had
received no information respecting the discovery of the
plot. The traitors, however, were not aware that the
sheriff was ignorant of their proceedings in London: on
the contrary, they imagined that he was sent after them by
a special order from the court. They prepared, therefore, to
defend themselves, being resolved to sell their lives as
dearly as possible.</p>

<p>The sheriff promised to intercede with his majesty in
their favour, on the condition of their surrendering themselves,
being unacquainted with their treason. Several
proclamations had been sent into the country after the conspirators,
in which the necessity of preserving Percy alive
was strongly urged. But in those days a hundred miles
were not soon travelled over. It is stated by contemporary
authorities that the roads were very bad at the time; while
another reason assigned for the slow travelling of the messengers,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>who had carried the proclamations, is the shortness
of the days. It appears that travelling by night at that
time was never contemplated. Thus on the third day after
the discovery of the treason&mdash;the day on which the conspirators
met at Holbeach&mdash;the authorities in the counties, in
which the traitors were assembled, had received no tidings
even of the existence of a plot.</p>

<p>While they were occupied in making their preparations
in the house, a spark of fire dropped on about two pounds
of gunpowder, which had been laid on a plate near the
chimney, for the purpose of being dried. One of the party
chanced to throw a log of wood on the fire; this raised
the sparks, one of which fell on the powder, causing an explosion,
by which the roof of the house was blown off, and
the persons of Catesby, Rookwood, and Grant blackened
and scorched. It was remarkable that a bag of gunpowder,
of considerable size, which was lying in the room at the
time of the explosion, was blown into the court-yard without
being ignited, or none of the conspirators could have survived,
and thus the whole of the plot would have been for
ever enveloped in mystery. Catesby, Rookwood, and Grant
were partly disabled by the explosion, &#8220;so bearing in their
bodies,&#8221; says Fuller, &#8220;not &#963;&#964;&#953;&#947;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#945;, <i>the marks of the Lord
Jesus Christ</i>, but the print of their own impieties.&#8221; As
the house had caught fire it was deemed necessary to open
the doors and attempt to escape; but when the bars of the
outer gates were removed to permit the conspirators to rush
forth, the sheriff's men rushed in, so that escape was impossible.
The battle now raged in the court-yard of the
house with great violence. Catesby and Percy placed
themselves back to back, and fought, though the former
had been partly disabled by the explosion, with desperate
courage. One of the sheriff&#8217;s men levelled his piece across
a wall, taking deliberate aim at Catesby and Percy, both of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>whom fell by the same ball, the former dead on the spot,
and the latter mortally wounded<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>. The two Wrights also
were slain, during the encounter in the court of Littleton&#8217;s
house; Rookwood and one of the Winters were wounded;
and the rest were taken prisoners.</p>

<p>As soon as possible after the struggle, the conspirators
were lodged by the sheriff in the county gaol. In a short
space they were removed to London: and during the
journey, and especially as they approached the metropolis,
the people came in vast crowds to obtain a sight of men,
who had concocted and almost executed so desperate a
treason. Every one wished to see the faces of men, whose
names and whose deeds were now resounded from one end
of the country to the other.</p>

<p>Tresham remained in London during the commotion
consequent upon the discovery of the plot. He was taken
in a short time and lodged in prison. Robert Winter
evaded the search that was made for him during a short
space, but at length was apprehended. Sir Everard Digby
was also taken. The actual conspirators were thirteen in
number; four were slain in the conflict at Holbeach; the
rest were all taken soon after the discovery of the plot.
Tresham confessed in prison his share in the transaction.
He died before the day appointed for their trial. Eight of
them were brought to trial early in the next year, as will
be noticed in a subsequent chapter.</p>

<p>On the 9th of November the parliament assembled.
The king addressed them on the occasion in a lengthened
speech, in which he dwelt on the proceedings of the traitors,
and on the policy of the measures which had been enacted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>against recusants. James took a sort of review of all the
dangers to which he had been exposed, alluding especially
to the Gowry conspiracy. The speech abounds in good
sense, and sensible and judicious remarks are scattered over
all its parts. Alluding to the characters of the conspirators,
he very wisely observes, that there was nothing to induce
them to enter into this conspiracy, except a mistaken zeal
for their religion. He tells the lords and commons, that
as soon as the letter was shewn to him, he interpreted certain
expressions, contrary to the ordinary laws of grammar,
to refer to some explosion of gunpowder. Having
heard the speech from the throne, the parliament was adjourned
until the 21st of the ensuing January.</p>

<p>When the discovery of the plot was known on the Continent,
several of the sovereigns sent to congratulate the
king on his escape. In the case of some of these sovereigns,
their congratulations were sincere; but in other
cases the language of deceit must have been used. The
king of Spain and the pope, were among the most forward
to congratulate his majesty; and yet with great inconsistency
they sheltered and protected some of those individuals who
fled from their own country, and were privy to the conspiracy.
Osborn assures us, however, that the pope could
not refrain from laughing in the face of <i>Cardinal D&#8217;Ossat</i>,
when he informed him, that the Spanish monarch had sent
a special messenger to the English court for that express
purpose. Indeed, all these congratulations were hollow and
insincere; but they would have been exposed to censure as
men and as sovereigns, if they had not so far acted the part
of hypocrites as to pretend to rejoice at the escape of the
English monarch.</p>

<p>That the pope and the king of Spain, and some other
papal sovereigns, would have rejoiced at the success of the
plot, can scarcely be doubted, since their subsequent actions,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>as will be noticed in another chapter, proved that they
favoured those who were privy to the conspiracy. It can
scarcely indeed be doubted that the Spanish sovereign, and
his holiness, and perhaps some other sovereigns, were
acquainted with the designs of the conspirators; at all
events, if they were not aware of the particulars of the
plot, they knew that some conspiracy was in agitation,
which was intended to be executed during that winter.
Many of the Romanists on the Continent knew that some
great deed was to be attempted, though they did not know
the particulars.</p>

<p>The parliament did not meet on the 5th of November;
but the following entry stands on the journals of the House
of Commons under that date:&mdash;&#8220;This last night the upper
house of parliament was searched by Sir Thomas Knevett;
and one <i>Johnson</i>, servant to Mr. Thomas Percye, was there
apprehended, who had placed thirty-six barrels of gunpowder
in the vault under the house, with a purpose to
blow up the king and the whole company when they should
there assemble. Afterwards, divers other gentlemen were
discovered to be of the plot<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>.&#8221;</p>

<p>On the 21st of January, the two houses assembled according
to the previous arrangement, when a committee was formed
&#8220;to consider the laws already in force, that tend to the
preservation of religion&mdash;what defects are in the execution
of them, or what new laws may be thought needful<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>.&#8221; The
lord chancellor gave special directions to the clerk to notice
the peers who should fail to attend in their places; for
there was a suspicion that certain Roman Catholic lords
were implicated in the treason. Some were in consequence
imprisoned and fined. In the House of Commons the same
subject was discussed the first day of the session. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>minds of men indeed could dwell on nothing else; nor is it
surprising that such was the case; for a most horrible plot
had been discovered, and the traitors were already in prison
awaiting the sentence of the law. At length a committee
was appointed to decide upon some course to be taken
against <i>jesuits</i>, <i>seminaries</i>, and other <i>papal agents</i>.</p>

<p>The conspirators were tried and convicted at common
law, as will be related in the next chapter; but the parliament
seemed anxious to award some new punishment, beyond
that which was ordinarily inflicted on traitors, on such
culprits, for the purpose of marking their sense of their
crime. Accordingly a committee was appointed in the lords
to consider what extraordinary punishments should be inflicted.
While they were engaged in this business, it was
reported to the house, that it was not convenient to delay
longer the trial of the conspirators, and therefore the matter
dropped. The commons were no less anxious on the subject
than the lords. The question was debated at some
length; but at last it was determined, that the conspirators
should be left to the ordinary courts of justice. On the
25th of January, however, the commons framed and passed
a bill, which was sent up to the lords, entitled, <i>&#8220;An Act
for Appointing a Thanksgiving to Almighty God every
year on the Fifth of November.&#8221;</i> When the bill was
carried to the lords, the messengers stated, &#8220;that the whole
body of the commons having entered into consideration of
the great blessing of God, in the happy preservation of his
majesty and the state, from the late most dangerous treason
intended to have been attempted by the instigation of
<i>jesuits</i>, <i>seminaries</i>, and <i>Romish priests</i>, had framed and
passed the said bill in their house, as the first fruits of their
labours, in this session of parliament, which they did very
earnestly recommend to their lordships.&#8221; The lords read
and passed the bill in three days, without even going into a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>committee. This act is, therefore, the <i>first</i> in the printed
statutes of the session. Several bills were passed against
recusants and as a protection to the Protestant religion. On
the 27th of May the session was terminated<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>.</p>

<p>It may be mentioned, that the ceremony of examining
the vaults is performed at the commencement of every
session. Whether indeed it has been continued since the
destruction of the two houses by fire, I am unable to determine;
but as the cellar must still remain, I should imagine
that the ceremony is still repeated. At all events, such
was the case prior to the fire. The cellar is still designated
Guy Fawkes&#8217;s Cellar.</p>

<p class="summary short">TRIAL OF THE CONSPIRATORS.</p>


<p class="newsection"><span class="smcap">The</span> conspirators, who had been lodged in prison, were
frequently examined respecting the plot in which they had
been engaged. Fawkes, Thomas Winter, Tresham, and
Sir Everard Digby, confessed that they were guilty of the
treason charged against them; and several of the particulars,
which I have detailed in the preceding chapters, were
revealed in these confessions. Catesby and Percy were
slain at Holbeach, or some other information respecting the
origin of the plot might have been obtained. It is probable,
too, that Percy might have been able to give some account
of the mysterious letter. For though the conspirators did
not suspect him as the writer, yet it is evident that such was
the impression on the mind of Lord Monteagle. To this
day the subject is involved in mystery. Several conjectures
have been formed, but the matter has never been cleared
up; and it is likely to continue to be involved in mystery,
until that great day when all secrets shall be unravelled, and
all difficulties removed.</p>

<p>Tresham, as before observed, died in prison, and was
thus spared the ignominy of a public execution. The other
conspirators, Robert Winter, Thomas Winter, Guy Fawkes,
John Grant, Ambrose Rookwood, Robert Keys, and Thomas
Bates, were arraigned and placed at the bar on the 27th of
January, 1605-6. The names of Garnet, Tesmond, and
Gerrard, all jesuits, were also specified in the indictment,
though none of them were taken. Garnet was subsequently
apprehended; but the other two jesuits evaded the pursuit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>of the officers of justice altogether. The jesuits are specially
charged in the indictment with persuading the other conspirators
to act, on the ground that the king was a heretic, and
that all heretics were accursed and excommunicated; and
that, consequently, it was lawful, nay even meritorious, to
kill the king, for the advancement of the see of Rome. The
seven individuals before mentioned are then charged with
consenting, and with contriving the plot, in conjunction with
the jesuits. It appears to have been arranged by the conspirators,
not to mention at first anything concerning a
change of religion in the event of the success of the plot:
and further, it was agreed not to avow the treason, until
they should have acquired sufficient power to secure the
completion of their plans. When the usual questions were
asked they all pleaded Not Guilty.</p>

<p>The indictment was opened by Sir Edward Philips, one
of the king&#8217;s sergeants-at-law. This gentleman stated the
case to the jury in a speech partly political and partly theological.
Treason was the subject, but, said he, &#8220;of such
horror, and monstrous nature, that before now, the tongue
of man never delivered, the ear of man never heard, the
heart of man never conceited, nor the malice of hellish or
earthly devil ever practised.&#8221; In the course of his speech
he further stated, that the object of the traitors was &#8220;to
deprive the king of his crown; to murder the king, the
queen, and the prince; to stir up rebellion and sedition in
the kingdom; to bring a miserable destruction upon the
subjects; to change, alter, and subvert the religion here
established; to ruinate the state of the commonwealth, and
to bring in strangers to invade it.&#8221; That such were their
objects there can be no doubt.</p>

<p>Sir Edward Coke, the attorney-general, followed in a
long speech, in which he stated, and then animadverted on,
all their proceedings, from the commencement of the plot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>until its discovery. &#8220;Surely,&#8221; said Sir Edward, &#8220;of these
things we may truly say, <i>Nunquam ante dies nostros talia
acciderunt</i>, neither hath the eye of man seen, nor the ear of
man heard, the like things to these.&#8221;</p>

<p>The particulars recorded in the preceding chapters were
many of them taken from the confessions of some of the
conspirators; and the speech of the attorney-general was
founded, in a great measure, on the same confessions.
Many things, indeed, could not have been made known in
any other way. Several days had been occupied in examining
the parties in prison; so that the law officers of the crown
came to the trial amply prepared with materials. In tracing
the progress of the treason, Sir Edward remarked, &#8220;It had
three roots, all planted and watered by jesuits and English
Roman Catholics: the first root in <i>England</i>, in <i>December</i>
and <i>March</i>; the second in <i>Flanders</i>, in <i>June</i>; the third
in <i>Spain</i>, in <i>July</i>. In England it had two branches; one
in <i>December</i> was twelve months before the death of the late
queen of blessed memory; another in <i>March</i>, wherein she
died.&#8221; He then specifies some of the acts in which Garnet
and others were concerned, previous to the accession of
James, and which have already been detailed in a preceding
chapter.</p>

<p>Some important particulars are stated in the speech of Sir
Edward Coke, respecting the conduct of the government
towards the papists, after James&#8217;s accession. During the
reign of Elizabeth, severe measures were never adopted
against <i>recusants</i>, as Roman Catholics were then usually
designated in acts of parliament, until their own conduct, or
at all events, the conduct of some members of the church of
Rome, rendered it absolutely necessary. The laws, respecting
which so much has been said by Roman Catholic
writers, were enacted in self-defence. Had there been no
treasons no such laws would have been devised; but when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>the members of the church of Rome planned, and endeavoured
to execute, treasons, and of such a nature that the
existing laws did not meet them, it became necessary to
devise such methods as should not permit the traitors to
escape. The origin, therefore, of the penal laws against
the Romanists, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, is to be
found in their own treasonable practices; and the same
remark will apply also to the reign of King James. Indeed,
James was disposed to act with all possible leniency. Cruelty
was foreign to his nature. Had the Romanists remained
quiet, none would have been punished during his reign for
their religious principles. Nay, so leniently did James act,
even after the discovery of the gunpowder treason, that
the puritans hesitated not to charge him with leaning
towards popery.</p>

<p>The question relative to the penal laws is clearly and
forcibly stated by Sir Edward Coke: &#8220;Concerning those
laws, which they so calumniate as unjust, it shall in a few
words plainly appear, that they were of the greatest, both of
moderation and equity, that ever were any: for from the
year I Eliz. unto XI. all papists came to our church and
service without scruple. I myself have seen <i>Cornewallis</i>,
<i>Beddingfield</i>, and others at church. So that then, for the
space of ten years, they made no conscience nor doubt to
communicate with us in prayer; but when once the bull of
Pope <i>Pius Quintus</i> was come and published, wherein the
queen was accursed and deposed, and her subjects discharged
of their obedience and oath, yea, cursed if they did
obey her: then did they all forthwith refrain from church,
then would they have no more society with us in prayer.
So that recusancy in them is not for religion, but in an acknowledgment
of the pope&#8217;s power, and a plain manifestation
what their judgment is concerning the right of the
prince in respect of regal power and place.&#8221; This is the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>true state of the case respecting the laws against recusants.
Sir Edward Coke specifies various treasons during the
queen&#8217;s reign, and then adds: &#8220;<i>Anno</i> XXIII. <i>Eliz.</i> after
so many years sufferance, there were laws made against
recusants and seditious books.&#8221; He then alludes to the
coming over of the <i>seminary priests</i>, who were Englishmen,
educated and ordained on the Continent, and who came
over into this country for the express purpose of stirring
up rebellion, and to bring over the queen&#8217;s subjects to the
see of Rome. &#8220;Then,&#8221; says he, &#8220;XXVII. <i>Eliz.</i> a law was
made, that it should be treason for any, (not to be a priest
and an Englishman, born the queen&#8217;s natural subject,) but
for any being so born her subject, and made a Romish
priest, to come into her dominions, to infect any her loyal
subjects with their treasonable practices; yet so, that it concerned
only such as were made priests since her majesty
came to the crown, and not before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Concerning the execution of these laws,&#8221; he adds, &#8220;it
is to be observed likewise, that whereas in the quinquencey
of Queen Mary, there were cruelly put to death about three
hundred persons for religion: in all her majesty&#8217;s time, by
the space of forty-four years and upwards, there were for
treasonable practices executed in all not <i>thirty priests</i>, nor
above five receivers and harbourers of them; <i>and for
religion not any one</i>.&#8221; He proceeds: &#8220;Now, against the
usurped power of the see of <i>Rome</i>, we have of former times
about <i>thirteen</i> several acts of parliament, so that the crown
and king of <i>England</i> is no ways to be drawn under the
government of any foreign power whatsoever.&#8221; This is an
important point. It was no new thing in England to enact
laws against the papal jurisdiction. The words of King
James himself are very strong: &#8220;I do constantly maintain,
that no man, either in my time, or in the late queen&#8217;s, ever
died here for his conscience. For let him be never so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>devout a papist, nay, though he profess the same never so
constantly, his life is in no danger by the law, if he break
not out into some outward act expressly against the words
of the law, or plot not some unlawful or dangerous practice
or attempt; priests and popish churchmen only excepted,
that receive orders beyond the seas; who for the manifold
treasonable practices that they have kindled and plotted in
this country, are discharged to come home again under pain
of treason, after their receiving of the said orders abroad;
and yet without some other guilt in them than bare homecoming,
have none of them been ever put to death<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>.&#8221; The
laws regarded not their religious opinions, but their practices.
Will any papist assert that the priests and others
did not endeavour to compass the death of Elizabeth, and to
exclude King James from the throne?</p>

<p>It is remarked by Sir Edward Coke, in the address to
the jury, that during the year and four months since James&#8217;s
accession, no penalty had been inflicted on any recusant.
The conspirators could not, therefore, allege that they were
driven to such a desperate course, by the harsh treatment
which they had received. The plea of religion was, however,
urged by these men: and that plea was especially
grounded on the laws which had been enacted in the late
reign against recusants. They appeared to exult in the fact,
that the place in which the unjust laws, as they termed them,
had been framed, would be the scene of vengeance.</p>

<p>When the attorney-general had finished his address to
the jury, the confessions of the conspirators were read, and
acknowledged by the parties. It was proved on the trial
that Hammond, a jesuit, after the discovery of the treason,
actually gave the conspirators absolution on Thursday,
November the 7th. This act is conclusive as to the part
taken by the jesuits in the plot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>A verdict of <i>guilty</i> was returned against the whole
number who were arraigned at the bar. They were asked
in the usual form why sentence of death should not be pronounced.
Thomas Winter merely desired that his brother
might be spared, because he was implicated in the treason
by his persuasion. Fawkes objected to certain parts of the
indictment, of which he said he was ignorant; when he was
told that they were inserted as a matter of form. Bates
supplicated for mercy, and did not deny his guilt. Robert
Winter pursued the same course. Grant, after remaining
silent some time, confessed that he was guilty of a conspiracy
intended, but never executed. Rookwood at first
attempted to justify himself, but at last acknowledged his
offence, admitting that he justly deserved to undergo the
penalty of the law; still he supplicated for mercy on the
ground that he was neither the author of the plot nor an
actor in it, but merely drawn into it by his affection for
Catesby.</p>

<p>At this stage of the business a circumstance was mentioned
to the court which had transpired in the prison. On
Friday before the trial commenced Robert Winter and
Fawkes were permitted to converse together in their cells.
The former said that he and Catesby had sons, and that
boys would be men, and he hoped that they would avenge
the cause. They also expressed their sorrow that no one
had set forth a defence or justification of the plot.</p>

<p>Sentence was not immediately pronounced; but Sir
Everard Digby, who had been some time in custody, was
arraigned at the bar on a separate indictment. He was
charged with being privy to the plot,&mdash;with having taken
the oath of secresy,&mdash;and also with open rebellion in the
country with the rest of the conspirators, subsequent to the
discovery. He had previously made a confession of his
guilt, and, therefore, did not attempt to defend himself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>before the court. As he was preparing to address the
court, he was informed that he must first plead either
<i>guilty</i> or <i>not guilty</i>. He immediately confessed that he
was guilty of the treason charged against him in the indictment.
Sir Everard Digby evidently would not have
been implicated in this conspiracy, but for his zeal in behalf
of the church of Rome. So strong was his attachment to
the papal creed, that he appears to have imagined that he
should do God service by concurring with others in the
destruction of heretics.</p>

<p>Having pleaded guilty to the charge of treason, he
addressed the court respecting the motives that had induced
him to enter upon such a course. He declared that neither
ambition nor discontent induced him to unite with the other
conspirators, but affection for Catesby the leader. He also
confessed that he was influenced in his decision by religious
considerations. Perceiving, as he said, that religion was
in danger, he had resolved to hazard his property, and even
his life, to preserve it, and to restore Romanism in this
country. It appears that the Romanists were apprehensive
of more severe laws being enacted under King James than
those which had been carried by the late queen. There
was no ground for such an apprehension, since King James
was really anxious to treat his Roman Catholic subjects
with great lenity. Sir Everard also requested that his wife
and children might not suffer on his account. His last
request was that he might be put to death by being beheaded,
and not as an ordinary traitor.</p>

<p>The attorney-general replied to his address in a strain
not unusual in that age, but which would not be adopted in
the present day against the greatest criminal. Alluding
to his very natural plea for his wife and children, Coke
reminded him, in an insulting and sneering tone, of his
attempt to kill the king and queen with the nobility of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>country, asking where his piety and affection were when
this scheme was devised?</p>

<p>When Coke charged him with justifying the fact he
denied the charge, confessing that he deserved to suffer, but
that he was a petitioner for his majesty&#8217;s mercy. The attorney-general
replied, that, having abandoned every principle
of religion and honour, he could not expect to receive
any favour from his majesty.</p>

<p>The earl of Northampton also addressed the prisoner,
and in a strain somewhat milder than Coke. It would
shock the feelings of the present age were the judge on the
bench to revile the criminal at the bar, however notorious
his guilt; but at that time such a practice was common. The
earl of Northampton told him, that he had only himself and
his evil councillors to thank. He also reminded him of his
favour with Queen Elizabeth; and that King James was
not ill disposed either towards him or the members of his
church generally.</p>

<p>Judgment was now demanded by the king&#8217;s sergeant
on the seven prisoners mentioned in the first indictment, on
the verdict of the jury; and on Sir Everard Digby, on his
own confession.</p>

<p>The lord chief-justice proceeded to pronounce judgment.
He first took a review of the laws which had been enacted
in the reign of Elizabeth against recusants, priests, and the
receivers of priests, specifying the causes which gave rise to
those enactments, and demonstrating that they were necessary,
mild, equal, moderate, and capable of being justified
to the whole world. Sentence was then pronounced in the
usual form.</p>

<p>Sir Everard Digby bowing to the lords who were seated
on the bench, said, &#8220;If I may but hear any of your lordships
say you forgive me, I shall go more cheerfully to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>gallows.&#8221; The lords instantly replied, &#8220;God forgive you,
and we do.&#8221;</p>

<p>On Thursday, January 30, 1605-6, Sir Everard Digby,
Robert Winter, John Grant, and Thomas Bates, were executed
at the west end of St. Paul&#8217;s church; and on Friday,
January 31st, the sentence of the law was carried into effect
on Thomas Winter, Ambrose Rookwood, Robert Keys, and
Guy Fawkes, in Old Palace-yard, Westminster, and at no
great distance from the House of Lords, the scene of their
recent treason.</p>

<p>Most of these wretched men evinced much penitence,
both in prison and on the scaffold. It is remarkable that
Fawkes, the most desperate of the whole number, appeared
to be the most penitent at the time of his execution. They
all declared their adherence to the church of Rome, dying,
as they had lived, in her communion. They requested that
the officers in attendance would communicate this their
dying declaration to the world.</p>

<p>After the execution, their bodies, being quartered,
were hung up in various parts of the city, as was the custom
at that time with those who were put to death for treason.
The heads of Catesby and Percy were fixed upon the House
of Lords, where they remained some years after, when
Osborne wrote his <i>Memoirs of King James</i>; unless, as he
intimates, they had been removed, and others substituted
in their room. It was reported when he wrote, that the
heads then fixed on the House of Lords were not those of
the two conspirators, but the heads of two other individuals
procured, probably, from some church-yard, by the friends
of Catesby and Percy, and fixed upon the poles for the
purpose of preventing the discovery of the theft<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>.</p>

<p>James acted with great lenity towards the families of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>the conspirators. By the statute respecting treason the property
of the convicted traitor is forfeited to the crown; but
in the cases of these individuals the children or heirs of
those who were in possession of property were permitted to
enjoy it. There was nothing vindictive in James&#8217;s character;
and he would have spared even these conspirators,
if it had been possible.</p>

<p>Such was the fate of men who appear to have been
guiltless of any other crime, and who would not have been
implicated in this horrible treason, but for the influence of
those principles which the church of Rome instilled into the
minds of her deluded followers.</p>

<p class="summary long">THE TRIAL AND EXECUTION OF GARNET, THE JESUIT&mdash;THE
ALLEGED MIRACLE OF THE STRAW&mdash;IS DECLARED
A MARTYR.</p>


<p class="newsection"><span class="smcap">Some</span> time elapsed before Garnet was taken. He concealed
himself in various places during the few months
immediately subsequent to the discovery of the plot; the
strictest search, however, was made; rewards were offered
for his apprehension; and at last he was taken with Hall,
another jesuit, and his own servant, in the house of a
Roman Catholic. The servant became his own executioner
in the prison. The proclamation against Garnet and the
other jesuits, is dated January 14, 1605-6; but he was
not taken at the end of the month when the other conspirators
were executed. He did not, however, long elude
the pursuit which was instituted.</p>

<p>On Friday, March 26, 1605-6, he was brought to trial
at the Guildhall, in the city of London, before the lord
mayor, several members of the king&#8217;s council, and certain
of the judges. During his imprisonment he was treated
with much leniency, as he himself confessed on his trial.
In the indictment the various names of the prisoners were
specified; from which document we gather that he was
known under different designations according to circumstances.
Wally, Darcy, Roberts, Farmer, Philips, were
the names assumed by Garnet on different occasions for
the purpose of concealment. The indictment charged the
prisoner, with concurring with Catesby, and the other conspirators,
in the plot against the king and the state. The
jury were sworn, and the prisoner pleaded <i>not guilty</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>Sir Edward Coke, the attorney-general, proceeded to
open the case: and as this trial reflects much light on the
whole conspiracy, I shall notice all those parts which appear
to me of the most importance.</p>

<p>The attorney-general stated in the outset, that this trial
was but a latter act of that dismal tragedy, commonly
called the Powder Treason, for which several had already
suffered the extreme penalty of the law. Throughout the
trial he treated Garnet with great respect. From Sir
Edward Coke&#8217;s speech we learn, that Garnet was examined
for the first time February 13th, and that from that day to
the 26th of March, when the last examination took place, he
was examined before the council more than twenty times.</p>

<p>In speaking of the treason, Sir Edward remarks, &#8220;I
will call it the jesuits&#8217; treason, as belonging to them, both
<i>ex congruo et condigno</i>: they were the proprietaries,
plotters, and procurers of it.&#8221; He then enters on a description
of some of the treasons, which were planned in
the reign of Queen Elizabeth, in which also Garnet was
concerned, as I have noticed in a preceding chapter.
Garnet confessed several particulars respecting those transactions
in which he had been engaged; and among other
things he admitted that the Romanists in England, after
the bull of excommunication had been issued against the
queen, were permitted to render her obedience with certain
cautions and limitations, namely, <i>Rebus sic stantibus</i>, and
<i>Donec publica bull&aelig; executio fieret posset</i>. So that while
things continued in their present state, and till such time
as the bull could be executed, the Romanists might obey
the queen. This was confessed by Garnet himself.</p>

<p>It appears that Garnet came over into England in the
year 1586, two years before the sailing of the <i>Spanish
Armada</i>. As early as the reign of Edward the First, the
bringing in of a bull from Rome against any of the king&#8217;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>subjects, without permission, was adjudged to be treason;
so that Garnet was a traitor by the ancient laws of the
land, for the bulls against King James were committed to
the keeping of that individual. The attorney-general had
declared, when speaking of Elizabeth, that four years had
never passed without a treason: and he adds, when he
speaks of King James, &#8220;and now since the coming of
great King James, there have not passed, I will not say
four years, but not four, nay not two months, without some
treason.&#8221; In these treasons Garnet and other jesuits were
implicated. The bulls which had been sent to Garnet
before the death of Elizabeth, and which were intended to
prevent the English Romanists from receiving any but a
popish sovereign, were burnt by him, as already mentioned,
when he perceived that King James&#8217;s accession could not be
prevented. There would have been danger in preserving
them, therefore they were committed to the flames. The
prisoner admitted that he had destroyed them.</p>

<p>It was shown on the trial that Garnet was privy to
the plot in various ways. Though Catesby was the only
layman with whom he would converse on the subject, yet
he did not hesitate to confer with his brother jesuits respecting
all the particulars. Greenwell pretended to confess
himself to Garnet his superior. Confession is appointed
by the church of Rome to be performed by the penitent in
a kneeling posture; but it seems that, on this occasion, the
two parties walked together; and during this walk Garnet
heard all the particulars of the treason&mdash;how it was to be
executed&mdash;and what was to take place subsequently. It
was proved also that he had proposed writing to the pope
on the subject, and that he met Catesby and some other of
the conspirators in Warwickshire. It will be seen that he
prayed for the success of the great action; and it is also a
certain fact, that all the English Romanists prayed for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>success of the plot, whatever it might be, which they knew
was in agitation, though they were not acquainted with its
precise nature.</p>

<p>On the morning of November the 6th, when the plot
had failed, Catesby and some of the other conspirators sent
Bates to Garnet, who was then in Warwickshire, to entreat
his assistance in stirring up the people to open rebellion.
Greenwell was at this time with Garnet. Warwickshire
was appointed to be the place of meeting after the plot;
and on this account the jesuits assembled in that county.</p>

<p>I have mentioned that Garnet admitted that he was
acquainted with the plot, though he pretended that it was
revealed to him in confession, and that consequently he
was not at liberty to reveal it, a point which I shall notice
in a subsequent page. The means adopted to procure his
confession were curious, and perhaps not strictly justifiable.
A trap was set for the prisoner into which he readily fell.</p>

<p>For some time he would confess nothing. In those
days it was customary to extort confessions from prisoners,
by means of torture, a mode long since abolished in this
country; but the king and his ministers did not wish to
render themselve obnoxious to the Romanists by resorting
to the rack. Instead, therefore, of using torture, they
employed craft; and though Garnet was an adept in the art
of dissimilation, yet he was outwitted on this occasion. An
individual was appointed as the keeper of the prisoner, who,
by pretending to deplore the condition of the Romanists
in England, as well as by complaints against the king and
his ministers, at length succeeded in inducing Garnet to
believe that he was well affected to the church of Rome.
Two letters were written by Garnet, and entrusted to this
man, the one addressed to a lady, the other to a priest. In
the former letter he mentioned what things he had already
admitted in his examinations; but the second letter was the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>more important. The letter was written on a sheet of
paper, and appeared to contain matters only of an ordinary
kind, such as any one might read. He had, however, left
a very broad margin, which circumstance excited suspicion
in the breasts of the council. Nor were these suspicions
without foundation; for on examining the letter, by holding
it to the fire, it was found that he had written on the margin
with the juice of a lemon, beseeching his friends to deny
the truth of those things which he had already confessed.
He also expressed his hope, that he should escape from the
powder plot from want of proof; yet he had confessed to the
lords of the council, that he was guilty. It appears, however,
that he did not really expect to escape; for in this
same letter he applies the words of Caiaphas, who used
them when speaking of the Saviour, to himself, <i>Necesse
est ut unus homo moriatur pro populo</i>.</p>

<p>This letter, written with his own hand, was shown to
him at the trial. It is still in existence. Some years ago
it was discovered by Mr. Lemon in the State Paper Office,
where it is still preserved, not only as a proof of Garnet&#8217;s
guilt, but also as evidence, that the principles of the church
of Rome are not misrepresented by Protestant writers.</p>

<p>The man who had taken the charge of these letters conveyed
them immediately to the lords of the council. The
object was to have some public confession of his guilt on
his trial. They were apprehensive that he might deny even
what he had privately stated to the lords, which was much
less than what he had admitted in these letters. The trap
which had been set for him by the sage counsellors of his
majesty was not set in vain.</p>

<p>But other evidence was soon produced. The individual
to whom the letters were entrusted gained his entire confidence.
Garnet told him that he was very anxious to see
Hall, another jesuit, known also by the name of Oldcorn,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>who was then confined in the same prison. The keeper
promised to arrange a meeting between them. For this
purpose they were so placed, that they could converse together,
while he, to avoid suspicion, took a position so as to be
seen by both. At the same time two other individuals were
secreted in the prison sufficiently near to hear all that
passed between the prisoners. They conversed freely respecting
their previous confessions and examinations&mdash;the
excuses and evasions which they had prepared, and many
other matters connected with the plot. During the conversation
Garnet remarked to Hall, &#8220;They will charge me
with my prayer for the good success of the great action, in
the beginning of the parliament, and with the verses which
I added at the end of my prayer.&#8221; He added, that in his
defence he should state, that the success for which he
prayed related to the severe laws, which he apprehended
would, during the session, be enacted against the Romanists.
The verses alluded to were as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Gentem auferte perfidam<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Credentium de finibus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ut Christo laudes debitas,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Persolvamus alacriter.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The next day Garnet and Hall were examined separately,
when they were charged with having held a private
conference. Garnet denied the fact in the most decided
terms. The parties who heard the conversation were then
produced: nor could Garnet object anything against their
statements.</p>

<p>Garnet said on his trial that he once thought of revealing
the plot, but not the conspirators. Cecil asked who
hindered him from making the discovery; to whom he replied,
&#8220;You, yourself; for I knew you would have racked
this poor body of mine to pieces, to make me confess.&#8221;
Fuller remarks on this assertion and in allusion to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>interview with Hall, that &#8220;never any <i>rack</i> was used on
Garnet, except a <i>witrack</i>, wherewith he was worsted, and
this cunning archer outshot in his own bow. For being in
prison with <i>Father Oldcorn alias Hall</i>, they were put into
an <i>equivocating room</i> (as I may term it) which pretended
nothing but privacy, yet had a reservation of some invisible
persons within it, ear witnesses to all the passages betwixt
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>These confessions, denials, evasions, and palliations
were defended by Garnet under the plea of lawful <i>equivocation</i>,
a doctrine then at least taught very generally in the
church of Rome. Under shelter of this plea the jesuits
were prepared, not merely to conceal or to deny any fact,
but also to aver what they knew to be false. It was urged,
and in books too, that such a course might be adopted on
the ground that the parties reserved in their own minds a
secret and private sense. Thus any question might be
eluded: and this practice was publicly defended in a treatise
licensed by Garnet and Blackwall. Certain instances are
given in the work as illustrations of the doctrine. The
following is one of these cases. A man arrives at a certain
place, and is examined on oath at the gate, whether
he came from London, where the plague is supposed to be
raging at the time. The man, knowing that the plague is
not in London, or that he did no more than pass through
that city, may swear that he did not come from London.
It is argued, that such an answer would agree with their
intention, who proposed the question simply with a view to
ascertaining, whether their own city would be endangered
by his entrance. Such was the doctrine of equivocation,
under the plea of which Garnet sheltered himself when he
denied many things which were proved against him, and
which he had himself confessed. Even Sir Everard Digby
resorted to this papal doctrine of equivocation, as will be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>seen from the following extracts from his letters discovered
in 1675, and published by Bishop Barlow, in 1679:&mdash;&#8220;Yesterday
I was before Mr. Attorney and my Lord Chief Justice,
who asked me if I had taken the sacrament to keep
secret the plot as others did. I said that I had not, because
I would avoid the question of at whose hands it were.&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;I
have not as yet acknowledged the knowledge of any priest
in particular, nor will not do to the hurt of any but myself,
whatsoever betide me.&#8221; Speaking of a particular priest, he
says in another letter; &#8220;I have not been asked his name,
which if I had, should have been such a one as I knew not of.&#8221;
Again; &#8220;If I be called to question for the priest, I purpose
to name him Winscombe, unless I be advised otherwise.&#8221;
And, alluding to the same in a subsequent letter&mdash;&#8220;You
forget to tell me whether Winscombe be a fit name. I like
it, for I know none of it.&#8221; In another letter&mdash;&#8220;As yet they
have not got of me the affirming that I know any priest
particularly, nor shall ever do to the hurt of any one but
myself.&#8221; It is evident that he deemed it lawful to deny
anything calculated to bring reproach on his church; and
that he did not scruple to give a false name on his examination.
From the manner in which he speaks, there
can be no doubt, that he believed he might lawfully equivocate.
And from whom had he learned this monstrous doctrine?
From the church and her authorized teachers!!</p>

<p>The earl of Salisbury alluded on the trial to his denial
of the conversation with Hall, reminding him that he was
not questioned as to the matter of their conferences, but
simply as to the fact. Hall confessed the fact, and Garnet,
though he had so strongly denied it, then admitted the
whole. On being reminded of the matter by Cecil, he replied,
that when a man is asked a question before a magistrate
he is not bound to give an answer <i>quia nemo tenetur
prodere seipsum</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>Tresham, who died in the Tower, accused Garnet of a
previous treason in entering into a league with the king of
Spain against England. Before his death he was permitted
to see his wife, who was aware of his confession respecting
Garnet. Under her influence he dictated to his servant,
being too weak to use a pen himself, that he had not seen
Garnet during the last sixteen years, and retracted his previous
confession in which he admitted the contrary. Now
it was proved, and acknowledged by Garnet, that they had
met several times within the last two years. Garnet was
asked to explain Tresham&#8217;s conduct; and his reply was, &#8220;I
think he meant to equivocate.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tresham died within three hours after dictating this
letter. Mrs. Vaux, however, confessed that she had seen
Tresham with Garnet at her house three or four times
since the accession of King James, and that they had dined
together with her. Garnet also publicly acknowledged that
he had seen Tresham. A second confession of Mrs
Vaux&#8217;s was also read in the court, in which she admits that
she was with Garnet at Tresham&#8217;s house in Northamptonshire
not long since.</p>

<p>Garnet made a long defence at the bar; and on the
question of equivocation he defended himself with much
subtilty. He declared that the church of Rome condemned
lying; but he justified equivocation, which, he said,
was &#8220;to defend the use of certain propositions. For a
man may be asked of one, who hath no authority to interrogate
or examine, concerning something which belongeth not
to his cognizance who asketh, as what a man thinketh, &amp;c.
So then no man may equivocate when he ought to tell the
truth, otherwise he may.&#8221; When he was reminded that he
had denied that he had written to Tesmond <i>alias</i> Greenwell,
or sent messages to him, he said he would not have
denied his letters if he had known that the lords had seen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>them; but supposing that they had not been seen he did
deny them, and that he might lawfully do so. This has
been confirmed by the papers in the State Paper Office.
There is amongst these papers an original letter, in Garnet&#8217;s
own hand, to Mrs. Vaux, in which he acknowledged
that he was so pressed by the testimony of two witnesses
who overheard the conversation between Hall and himself,
that he was, at length, determined to confess all
rather than stand the torture or trial by witnesses.</p>

<p>Garnet endeavoured to shelter himself from the guilt of
the plot, under the plea, that the treason was revealed to
him under the seal of confession. At first he endeavoured
to deny that he was acquainted with any particulars; but
being forced from this subterfuge, he admitted his knowledge,
but contended that he was bound to conceal all that
he knew. He acknowledged also that he had concealed the
treason with Spain. &#8220;Only,&#8221; says he, &#8220;I must needs confess,
I did conceal it after the example of Christ, who commands
us, when our brother offends to reprove him, for if
he do amend we have gained him.&#8221; With respect to the
Powder Treason he acknowledged, that Greenwell came to
him in great perplexity in consequence of what Catesby
had intimated. He consented to hear it, provided the fact
of his doing so should not be revealed to Catesby, or to
any other person. Greenwell then revealed the whole
plot. He confessed that he was greatly distressed on the
subject, &#8220;and sometimes prayed to God that it should not
take effect.&#8221; On being questioned why he did not reveal
the conspiracy he stated that, &#8220;he might not disclose it to
any, because it was matter of secret confession, and would
endanger the lives of divers men.&#8221; Cecil said, &#8220;I pray
you, Mr. Garnet, what encouraged Catesby that he might
proceed, but your resolving him in the first proposition?
What warranted Faukes, but Catesby&#8217;s explication of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>Garnet&#8217;s arguments? As appears infallibly by Winter&#8217;s
confession, and by Faukes, that they knew the point had
been resolved to Mr. Catesby, by the best authority.&#8221; It
was evident, therefore, that he did not merely conceal the matter;
but that he was an active instigator of the conspiracy.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>With respect to Garnet&#8217;s knowledge of the conspiracy,
it is perfectly clear that the matter was not merely revealed
in confession, but that he was one of the actors therein.
Nor was the plea of confession consistent with some of his
own declarations during his examinations. He admitted,
that the treason was mentioned to him in the way of consultation,
as a thing not yet executed; and moreover
Greenwell did not implicate himself; he merely told of
others, and consequently the seal of confession would not
have been broken, even if Garnet had revealed the whole
to the government. He chose, however, on his trial, to
adopt this line of defence, namely, that he was not at
liberty to disclose anything which was revealed to him in
sacramental confession. One of the lords asked him if a
man should confess to-day, that he intended to kill the
king to-morrow with a dagger, whether he must conceal the
matter? Garnet replied that he must conceal it. Parsons,
the jesuit, maintains the same opinion. Speaking of Garnet,
he remarks, that nothing was proved, &#8220;but that the prisoner
had received only a simple notice of that treason, by
such a means as he could not utter and reveal again by the
laws of Catholic doctrine, that is to say, in <i>confession</i>, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>this but a very few days before the discovery, but yet never
gave any consent, help, hearkening, approbation, or co-operation
to the same; but contrariwise sought to dissuade,
dehort, and hinder the designment by all the
means he could. He, dying for the bare concealing of
that, which, by God&#8217;s, and the church&#8217;s ecclesiastical laws,
he could not disclose, and giving no consent or co-operation
to the treason itself, should have been accounted rather a
<i>martyr</i> than a <i>traitor</i>.&#8221;&mdash;See an answer to Sir <span class="smcap">Edward
Coke&#8217;s</span> <i>Reports</i>, 4to. 1606.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that in a treatise published <small>A.D.</small> 1600,
on auricular confession, a case is put to this effect; namely,
whether if a confederate discover, in confession, that he or
his companions have secretly deposited gunpowder under a
particular house, and that the <i>prince</i> will be destroyed
unless it is removed, the priest ought to reveal it. The
writer replies in the negative, and fortifies his opinion by
the authority of a bull of Clement VIII., against violating
the seal of confession. This treatise was published at
<i>Louvain</i>. Bishop Kennet remarks on this treatise, in his
Sermon, November 5th, 1715, that it appeared &#8220;as if the
writer had already looked into the cellar and had surveyed
the powder, and had heard the confessions of the conspirators.&#8221;</p>

<p>The proceedings were at length brought to a close; and
judgment was demanded against the prisoner. When the
clerk of the crown asked what he had to say why judgment
should not be given, Garnet replied that &#8220;he could say
nothing, but referred himself to the mercy of the king and
God Almighty.&#8221; Judgment was pronounced in the usual
form, that the prisoner should be hanged, drawn, and
quartered.</p>

<p>On the third of May 1606, the prisoner was executed
on a scaffold erected at the west end of St. Paul&#8217;s church-yard.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>Overal, dean of St. Paul&#8217;s, with the dean of Winchester,
exhorted him to make a plain confession to the
world of the offence of which he had been convicted.
Garnet desired them not to trouble him, as he came prepared
to die, and was resolved what he should do. The
recorder asked if he had anything to say to the people
before his death, reminding him that it was not the time to
dissemble, and that his treasons were manifest to the world.
Garnet evidently had no wish to address the crowd; and
without refusing the permission, he alleged that his voice
was weak, his strength exhausted, and that the people
would be unable to hear him, except in the immediate
vicinity of the scaffold. To those who stood near, however,
he said that the intention was wicked, and the fact would
have been cruel, and that he entirely abhorred it. He was
reminded that he had confessed his own participation in the
plot. It was also stated, that he had acknowledged, under
his own hand, that Greenway had asked him who should be
protector? and that he had replied that the matter was to
be deferred until the blow was actually struck. He confessed
that he had erred in not revealing all that he knew
of the plot; but he refused to make any further declaration
on the scaffold.</p>

<p>He kneeled down at the foot of the ladder; but so distracted
was he during his prayer, that he constantly paused
and looked about him, as if in expectation of a pardon.
He now expressed his sorrow in dissembling with the lords,
but justified himself by saying, that he was not aware that
they were in possession of such proofs against him. Then
exhorting all Romanists to abstain from treasonable practices,
he was launched into eternity.</p>

<p>Garnet was viewed as a martyr by his church after his
death. Yet he had confessed himself guilty. When asked
by some of the lords on his examination, if he approved
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>that the church of Rome should one day declare him a
martyr, he cried, <i>Martyrem me, O qualem Martyrem</i>.
The church of Rome could not declare him a martyr however,
unless they could allege that a miracle had been
wrought at his death, or subsequent to it. A miracle
therefore was feigned, in order to pave the way into the
martyrology. This circumstance I will now relate.</p>

<p>While the body was quartered by the executioner, some
drops of blood fell upon the straw with which the scaffold
was strewed. A man of the name of Wilkinson, who was
present, was anxious to preserve some relic of the deceased,
and therefore carried home with him some of the straws
sprinkled with Garnet&#8217;s blood. These relics were committed
to the care of a woman, who preserved them under
a glass case. Wilkinson had come over from St. Omer&#8217;s
on purpose to be present at the execution. It was reported,
that the straws which had been carried away by Wilkinson
leaped up from the scaffold, or from the basket in which
the dissevered head was deposited, upon his person. Some
weeks after, on examining the straws, the parties pretended,
that they discovered a likeness of Garnet on one of the husks
which contained the grain. Wilkinson and several other
persons asserted that they perceived a likeness. The matter
was soon noised abroad, and the Romanists proclaimed that
a miracle had been wrought. It was thought necessary to
institute an examination into the matter; and accordingly
several witnesses gave their evidence before the archbishop
of Canterbury. Some persons had reported, that the head
on the ear of corn was surrounded with <i>glory</i>, or with
streaming rays; but Griffith, the husband of the woman
who had preserved the straw, declared, before the archbishop,
that he discovered nothing of the sort, and that the
face was no more like Garnet&#8217;s than that of any other man
who had a beard. Another witness deposed, that he believed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>that a good artisan could have drawn a better
likeness.</p>

<p>The matter, however, was not permitted to be forgotten;
and at Rome a print of the straw was published and
publicly exhibited. Some months afterwards Garnet was
declared to be a martyr by the pope; in which light he is
still regarded by Romanists. The miracle was undoubtedly
intended to afford the pope an excuse for his <i>beatification</i>,
which is the lowest degree of celestial dignity. &#8220;This
he did,&#8221; says Fuller, &#8220;to qualify the infamy of Garnet&#8217;s
death, and that the perfume of this new title might outscent
the stench of his treason.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Romanists of that day made the most of this
miracle. In a work published soon after, entitled, <i>The
True Christian Catholic</i>, it is boldly asserted that the
sight of Garnet&#8217;s straw caused at least five hundred persons
to embrace the Roman Catholic faith. The miracle was
published in all the Romanist states; but in England, it
was said, that the man who had been educated at Rome,
and commissioned to enter into a conspiracy against his
native country, deserved to be pictured in blood.</p>

<p>It appears from Osborne, a contemporary writer, that
more than one likeness was pretended. From his statement
it seems, that it was circulated, that all the husks in
the ears on the straws bore similar impressions of Garnet&#8217;s
features. Osborne says, that he had had some of these
straws in his hand; but that he could discover no resemblance
to a human face; &#8220;yet,&#8221; says he, &#8220;these no doubt
are sold and pass at this day for relics, as I know they did
twenty years after, and he for a holy saint<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Many false reports were circulated on the Continent respecting
his death. It was said that he evinced much readiness
to die, whereas he manifested great fear. It was also reported
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>that the people interposed and prevented the executioner from
quartering him while he was alive, but this favour was granted
by the command of the king; that the crowd nearly destroyed
the hangman, whereas no violence of any sort was used;
and that the people were perfectly silent when the head was
held up on the scaffold, whereas that act was attended with
loud acclamations. On the contrary, the people were with
difficulty restrained from taking the law into their own
hands, and inflicting summary punishment. The people
also understood that Spain and the pope had been plotting
with the traitors; and so high was their indignation, that it
was necessary for the Spanish ambassador to apply to the
government for a guard to protect him from the fury of the
populace. These reports were intended to divert attention
from his crime, and from the ignominy of his death. That
Garnet was a traitor against his sovereign and his country,
cannot be denied by any Romanists, without resorting to
the usual arts and sophistry of the jesuits, who contrive to
deny anything which it may be inconvenient to acknowledge.
Yet Bellarmine has defended him on the ground
that the treason was revealed in confession: &#8220;Why,&#8221; says
he, &#8220;was Henry Garnet, a man incomparable for learning
in all kinds and holiness of life, put to death, but because he
would not reveal that which he could not with a safe conscience?&#8221;
Garnet, however, as has been shown, acknowledged
that he ought to have revealed it; and besides, it
was proved on the trial, that he was acquainted with the
treason by other means than confession. He admitted that
the plot was revealed to him as they were walking, and
consequently not under the seal of confession.</p>

<p>The recently discovered papers in the State Paper
Office, confirm all the charges advanced against Garnet and
the other conspirators at their trial. In these documents there
is an account of Garnet&#8217;s examination. He is asked whether
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>he took Greenwell&#8217;s discovery of the plot to be in confession
or not? he answered, &#8220;Not in confession, but by way of
confession.&#8221;</p>

<p>It has already been proved that, by the ancient laws
even, it was treason to bring in a bull from Rome; yet
Garnet acknowledged that he held three such documents at
King James&#8217;s accession. And on his trial, he justified
himself, or rather palliated his offence, by stating, that he
had shown them to very few of his own party, when he
understood that the king was peaceably put in possession of
the throne. He committed the bulls to the flames, but not
till he had ascertained that they could not be executed, and
that it would be dangerous to retain them, lest they should
be discovered in the event of his being taken.</p>

<p>I have already alluded to the mode, in which the continuator
of Sir James Mackintosh&#8217;s <i>History of England</i> in
<i>Lardner&#8217;s Cyclop&aelig;dia</i>, writes the history of his country.
Another short sentence respecting Garnet, will show how
utterly regardless the writer is of truth in his statements:
&#8220;His guilt or innocence is a question of dispute to this
day.&#8221; He gives a reference to Lingard; but the words
are not given as a quotation. Yet Garnet acknowledged
his guilt, and it was clearly proved on the trial. Thus, in
a history intended for popular use, the guilt of a notorious
offender is questioned, and the principles of the church of
Rome indirectly defended. The writer further remarks,&mdash;&#8220;that
Garnet&#8217;s admissions were obtained by the most perfidious
and cruel acts of the inquisition; that conviction
under the circumstances of his trial, is scarcely a presumption
of guilt.&#8221; This is exactly the strain in which Romanists
are accustomed to speak of the plot. In short, the
writer has written as a Romanist, and appears to have
followed Lingard in every particular. Is such a man qualified
to write a history for popular use? But to disprove
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>all his assertions on this point, I simply quote a passage
from the <i>Trial</i>, which will prove that no cruel means were
resorted to in the case of Garnet. In addressing Garnet,
the earl of Salisbury said: &#8220;You do best know that since
your apprehension, even till this day, you have been as
Christianly, as courteously, and as carefully used, as ever
man could be, of any quality, or any profession; yea, it
may truly be said, that you have been as well attended for
health or otherwise, as a nurse-child. Is it true or no?&#8221;
said the earl. &#8220;It is most true, my lord,&#8221; said Garnet,
&#8220;I confess it.&#8221; Now, I ask, what dependence can be
placed on the continuator of the history in question? Yet
such men are employed in the present day to write books
for popular use.</p>

<p class="summary short">THE PRINCIPLES ON WHICH THE CONSPIRATORS
ACTED.</p>


<p class="newsection"><span class="smcap">In</span> this chapter I purpose to give a short account of those
principles, on which the conspirators acted, and which were
regarded by them as those of their church. I am ready to
allow, that many Roman Catholics deprecated the plot and
the course taken by the conspirators; but still it is by no
means easy to defend the church of Rome from the guilt of
the transaction, since she then entertained principles, which
appeared to justify the attempt of the parties who were implicated
in the treason. That the jesuits were the life and
soul of the conspiracy has already been shown in the
narrative. They animated the conspirators when they were
dispirited,&mdash;warranted the proposed action when they were
in doubt,&mdash;and absolved them from its guilt after the discovery.
Nay, they pronounced the deed to be meritorious.
They swore them to secresy, and bound them together to
the performance of the treason by means of the sacrament.
The great wheels, therefore, by which the whole was set in
motion, were the jesuits; but the arch-traitor was the pope
himself, who had sent his bulls into England, to endeavour
to prevent the accession of King James; for it has been
shown that the treason originated in those bulls.</p>

<p>I shall <i>first</i> briefly state the principles of the church of
Rome, on the question of heresy and heretical sovereigns;
and <i>secondly</i>, examine their practices prior to, and at the
period in question, to show how they corresponded exactly
with the principles then publicly avowed and defended.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>It is an acknowledged principle of the church of Rome,
that the decisions of general councils are binding on all.
There are disputes amongst her divines respecting some of
the councils, whether they were general, or not; but concerning
the decisions of those councils which have never
been disputed, there is no question with Romanists. Now
some of the undisputed councils enforce doctrines at variance
with Scripture, and destructive, not merely of the welfare,
but of the very existence, of Protestant states and Protestant
sovereigns, provided the papal see is sufficiently powerful
to carry out her principles into action. No king was completely
master in his own dominions, when the papacy was
at its height.</p>

<p>The first council to which I refer the reader is <i>The
Third Council of Lateran</i>, convened by Pope Alexander
III., <small>A.D.</small> 1179. Its efforts were directed especially against
the Albigenses and Waldenses, who were guilty of no
crime, except the unpardonable one of opposing the errors
of the church of Rome. Twenty-seven canons were framed
by this council; all of them on matters of trivial importance
with the exception of the last, which is directed against the
poor exiles who were bold enough to prefer their own salvation
to a blind submission to the church. The <i>Twenty-seventh</i>
canon imposes a curse on all those who maintained
or favoured the Waldensian opinions. In the event of
dying in their alleged errors, they were not even to receive
Christian burial<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>The fourth council of Lateran was held <small>A.D.</small> 1215.
One of its canons, the <i>Third</i>, is even more horrible than
the preceding. All heretics are excommunicated, and delivered
over to the secular arm for punishment; while temporal
princes are enjoined to extirpate heresy by all means
in their power<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>. This exterminating canon is still unrepealed,
and may be acted on whenever the church of Rome
may have the power to enforce it. It has been attempted
in modern times to deny the genuineness of the <i>Third
Canon</i>; but the attempt was unsuccessful. It has also
been pronounced <i>obsolete</i>. It is undoubtedly inoperative,
simply because the church cannot carry it into execution;
but it is still the law of the Roman church.</p>

<p>The council of Constance, <small>A.D.</small> 1415, decided that
faith was not to be kept with heretics to the prejudice
of the church; and, therefore, John Huss was committed
to the flames, in violation of the solemn promise of the
emperor.</p>

<p>By these councils all heretics are devoted to destruction.
They proclaim principles exactly similar to those on which
the conspirators acted;&mdash;in other words, the conspirators
acted on the principles promulgated by these councils, as
those of the church of Rome. On these principles did the
jesuits justify the treason, and declare the traitors innocent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>Attempts are made in modern times to prove that the
canons alluded to are not binding on the church; but the
hand of Providence has made the church of Rome set her
seal to her own condemnation in this matter; for by the
decrees of the council of Trent every papist is pledged to
receive the decisions of all general councils<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>. The only
question, therefore, to be decided is this, namely, whether
these councils are regarded as <i>general</i> by the church of
Rome. Respecting the <i>third</i> and <i>fourth</i> Lateran councils
there never was any doubt; and the creed of Pope Pius
IV., as well as the council of Trent, expressly enjoins the
reception of the decrees of all general councils<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>. It is
very remarkable, nay, I may say providential, that the
Fourth Lateran council is especially alluded to by the
council of Trent. One of the decisions of this very council
is specified and renewed by the Trent decrees. The
church of Rome has declared, therefore, by her last council,&mdash;a
council, too, by which all her doctrines were unalterably
fixed,&mdash;that the Lateran council is to be received by all
her members; and, as if to prevent all cavil on the subject,
and also to prevent any Romanist from saying that this
council was not a general one, and consequently not binding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>on the church, the council of Trent has expressly
designated it a general council. And still further, as if to
remove all doubt on the subject, the council of Trent has
particularly specified one of the Lateran decrees, by quoting
the first two words. The language of the council is remarkable:
&#8220;All other decrees made by Julius the Third, as
also the constitution of Pope Innocent the Third, in a
general council, which commences <i>Qualiter et Quando</i>,
which this holy synod renews, shall be observed by all<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>.&#8221;
Two things are here to be noted. First, the council held
under Innocent III. is expressly termed a general council;
and this council was the <i>Fourth Lateran</i>. Secondly, a
particular canon of the council is specified and renewed, so
that no doubt can possibly exist as to the particular council to
which the reference is made. It is not possible to establish
any point with greater precision than this, that the charge of
holding persecuting and exterminating doctrines is fastened
upon the church of Rome, by these decrees of the council
of Trent.</p>

<p>The reader will also perceive that the council of Trent
revives and confirms all the constitutions of the apostolic
see; that is, all the determinations of the canon law. It
would be easy to justify persecution and death from innumerable
portions of the canon law. And how can any
Romanist allege that the canon law is not binding, when it
is expressly confirmed by the council of Trent? It includes
all the bulls and decrees of the popes. None of the
persecuting decrees have been repealed; and until the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>church of Rome renounces them by a solemn and public
act, she will be obnoxious to the charge of maintaining the
duty of persecuting heretics. None of the laws respecting
heresy have ever been relaxed; no sovereign was ever
censured for punishing heretics; no council has ever relieved
the papal sovereigns from the execution of the laws
to which I have alluded; nor was any one ever condemned
by the head of the church for putting Protestants to death.
Until, therefore, Rome repeals her exterminating decrees,
she must submit to the heavy charge of maintaining the
right to persecute men for their religious belief.</p>

<p>It is well known that the <span class="smcap">Bull in C&#339;na Domini</span> is
read in the hearing of the pope every Maunday Thursday.
By that bull all Protestants are excommunicated and
anathematized; and will any one say that the church of
Rome would not execute the sentence of excommunication
if she possessed the power? To assert the contrary
assuredly argues either great obstinacy or egregious folly.</p>

<p>To the bull <i>In C&#339;na Domini</i> may be added the oath
to the pope taken by every bishop on his elevation to the
episcopal dignity, by which he engages to <i>persecute and
attack heretics</i>.</p>

<p>Such are the principles of the Romish church as embodied
in her councils and her canon law. If they are
true, then the gunpowder conspirators were justified in their
proceedings, nay, they were acting a meritorious part in
the prosecution of that design.</p>

<p>Nor have the doctors and eminent supporters of that
church hesitated to avow the same principles in days that
are past, though in modern times, it has been attempted to
deny them, or explain them away. How modern Romanists
can consistently deny that such doctrines are enjoined by
their church, appears to me inexplicable, except on the
jesuitical principle of equivocation, which will enable them to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>pursue any course calculated to advance the interests of the
apostolic see; and though Romanists generally repudiate
such doctrines, yet it is asserted in the theology of Dens,
and taught at Maynooth, and doubtless in other similar
institutions, that heretics are the subjects of the church
of Rome<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>. A host of writers might be alleged, who
assert that it is lawful to punish heretics with death. So
numerous are the passages in Romish authors on this
topic, and so well known, that I abstain from any quotations.
Still I will meet an objection not unfrequently
alleged by Romanists, when pressed in an argument by the
authority of names in high repute in their church, namely,
that &#8220;the church is not bound by the views of particular
individuals.&#8221; The views of these individuals, however, are
those of the church, as I have already proved. But further,
why are not these views censured if the church does not
maintain them? The church of Rome has published an
<i>Index Prohibitorum</i>, in which all Protestant works are
included; and an <i>Index Expurgatorius</i>, in which many
passages in the works of well known Romanists are marked
for erasure as containing sentiments akin to those of the
Protestant churches. As, therefore, the church of Rome
has not hesitated to expunge passages from the writings of
her own members, when she has deemed them at variance
with her principles, why, if she views those portions of the
works to which I allude, and which enforce the persecution
of heretics even to death, to be erroneous, does she not
adopt the same process respecting them? As she has not
done so, the undoubted inference is, that these writings are
not disapproved of by the church. It is not possible for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>any Romanist to object to this line of argument; nor can
it be charged with unfairness.</p>

<p>Nearly allied to the punishment of heresy is the question
of the pope&#8217;s deposing power. It is asserted in the canons
already quoted, and which cannot be disputed; and it is
also asserted by numerous writers, whose works have never
been censured in an <i>Index Expurgatorius</i>. Bellarmine
says, &#8220;It is agreed upon amongst all, that the pope may
lawfully depose heretical princes and free their subjects
from yielding obedience to them.&#8221; Can it be denied, therefore,
that such was the doctrine of the church of Rome in
the time of Bellarmine? And if such was the doctrine of
that church then, it must be the doctrine of the same
church now, since none of her articles of faith have been
changed, none of her doctrines have been repudiated. It
is true that the doctrine is not insisted on by modern
Romanists; but what security have we that the claim
would not be revived if the church of Rome should ever
possess sufficient power to enforce it? We must therefore
insist on charging these and similar doctrines on the church
of Rome, until she renounces them by a solemn and public
decision.</p>

<p>Tillotson&#8217;s observations on this question, in his sermon
on the fifth of November, are so just that I shall make no
apology for quoting them. &#8220;Indeed, this doctrine hath
not been at all times alike frankly and openly avowed; but
it is undoubtedly theirs, and hath frequently been put in
execution, though they have not thought it so convenient at
all times to make profession of it. It is a certain kind of
engine, which is to be screwed up or let down as occasion
serves: and is commonly kept like Goliah&#8217;s sword in the
sanctuary behind the ephod, but yet so that the high-priest
can lend it out upon an extraordinary occasion.
And for practices consonant to these doctrines, I shall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>go no further than the horrid and bloody design of this
day.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is singular that there is no express mention of the
deposing power in the council of Trent. The pope and
the fathers perceived that times were already altered, that
sovereigns were not likely to submit tamely to such an
assumption of authority, and that their proceedings must
be managed with more craft than formerly. Still the deposing
power was established by implication, in the ratification
of the decrees of the Lateran council; and we know
that it was exercised at a subsequent period against Queen
Elizabeth. Parsons declared, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth,
that it was the doctrine of all learned men, and
agreeable to the apostolic injunctions; and that the power
of deposing kings has not only been claimed, but acted
upon, may easily be proved. It was not always treated as a
speculative doctrine. History shows that many wars have
been waged through this very principle. In some cases the
papal sentence has been carried into effect, and in others it
has led to war and bloodshed, some states having always
been ready to attempt to carry the sentence into effect.</p>


<p class="thoughtbreak">The following list will show how frequently the Roman
pontiffs in the days of their glory, claimed and exercised
the power of deposing sovereigns.</p>

<ul class="depositions">

<li>1538. Paul III. deprived Henry VIII. of England.</li>
<li>1570. Pius V. deprived Queen Elizabeth, as did also
some of his successors.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a sample of papal attempts
against kings; and it proves that the popes have always
lost sight of St. Peter&#8217;s character, though acting as his
successors. Our own sovereigns have often felt the weight
of the papal power. King Edgar was enjoined by Dunstan,
the abbot of Glastonbury, not to wear his crown for seven
years, to which he was compelled to submit. Henry II.
was forced to walk barefooted three miles to visit Becket&#8217;s
shrine, and there to receive fourscore lashes from the monks
on his bare back. King John was compelled to resign his
crown to the pope&#8217;s legate, and take it back on condition of
paying a yearly sum of a thousand marks to the pope.</p>


<p class="thoughtbreak">The pages of history are pregnant with proofs that,
from the period of the Reformation, down to the time when
the papacy became shorn of much of its strength, the practices
of the church have exactly corresponded with the
principles asserted in the canons already specified, in the
canon law, and in the works of their eminent writers. I
have alluded to the bulls issued against Elizabeth, and to
the attempts of nations, and of individuals, to enforce them.
Elizabeth escaped; but several continental sovereigns fell a
sacrifice to the fury of the church of Rome. Henry III.,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>of France, was murdered in 1589, by a Dominican friar,
who was encouraged to the commission of the act by the
prior of his convent. Henry was a member of the church
of Rome; but he was not so zealous as the pope wished, in
executing the laws against heretics. On account, therefore,
of his supposed want of zeal, he was devoted to
destruction by the church. The deed was lauded in sermons
and in books, throughout the French territories;
while the murderer, who was destroyed on the spot, was
deemed a martyr in the cause of the church. At Rome,
the fact was applauded by the pope in a set speech to the
cardinals. The act was contrasted by his holiness, with
those of Eleazar and Judith, and the palm was given to the
friar. Nay, it was compared in greatness to the Incarnation
of our Lord Jesus Christ. I give the following extract
from this most blasphemous speech:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Considering seriously with myself, and applying myself
to these things which are now come to pass, I may use
the words of the prophet Habbakuk: &#8216;Behold, ye among
the heathen, and regard, and wonder marvellously; for I
will work a work in your days, which ye will not believe,
though it be told you;&#8217; i. 5. The French king is slain by
the hands of a friar. For unto this it may be compared,
though the prophet spake of our Lord&#8217;s incarnation. This
is a memorable and almost incredible thing, not accomplished
without the particular providence of God. A friar
has killed a king. That the king is dead, is credible; but
that he is killed in such a manner is hardly credible: even
as we assert that Christ is born of a woman; but if we add
of a virgin; then, according to human reason, we cannot
assent to it. This great work is to be ascribed to a particular
providence.&#8221;</p>

<p>In this strain did the head of the Roman church laud
the murder of Henry III. of France. The deed was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>reckoned by his holiness as glorious a work as the incarnation
of the Saviour, and his resurrection from the dead.
Surely, the principles and practices of the church, were in
exact correspondence at that time. The principles have
never been relinquished; but circumstances control the
actions of the church, so that she cannot kill and slay with
impunity.</p>

<p>Henry IV. of France also fell a sacrifice to the same
principles. He had been an advocate of Protestant doctrines;
but from motives of human policy he united himself
with the church of Rome. Still, as he did not persecute
his Protestant subjects, the sincerity of his conversion
was called in question by the church. In less than one
month after his public profession of the papal faith, an
attempt was made on his life by an assassin, who had been
encouraged by the reasonings of certain friars and jesuits.
After several escapes, he was stabbed in the street, by a
man who had formerly been a monk. His death was not
celebrated publicly by the pope, as was that of Henry III.,
but the jesuits and the friars justified the act, and proved
that, on the principles of the church, it was lawful to put
him to death, though a Romanist, since he was not zealous
against heresy, and in the cause of the papal see. King
Henry had also communicated secret information to Cecil,
prior to the discovery of the Gunpowder Treason, respecting
the machinations of the jesuits and seminary priests.
The particulars of their treason were unknown; but the
very fact that the French monarch should convey intelligence
to King James, was a deadly crime in the eyes of the
jesuits. It was supposed at the time, and nothing has
since transpired to lead to a different conclusion, that the
part he acted, in communicating information to the English
court, hastened his tragical end. I have remarked, that
the pope did not publicly applaud the act of the assassin;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>but it is a fact, that his memory was in consequence held
in great veneration at Rome, for a considerable period after
the event. Henry was supposed to be lukewarm in the
cause, and therefore it was determined to remove him out of
the way. The assassins of both these monarchs acknowledged,
that they were prompted to commit the murders, by
the instigation of two jesuits, and the reading of the works
of a third.</p>

<p>The massacre of St. Bartholomew is too well known to
need the recital of its horrid particulars. I allude to it
merely to show how the principles and practices of the
church of Rome correspond, whenever she has the power
to act. The deed was applauded at Rome, by the head of
the church. The crime was consecrated by the pope, who
went in grand procession to church, to return thanks to God
for so great a blessing as the destruction of the heretics.</p>

<p>It appears that the tidings of the massacre reached
Rome on the 6th of September, 1572. The consistory of
cardinals was immediately assembled, when the letter from
the papal legate, containing the particulars of the massacre,
was read. It was immediately determined to repair to the
church of St. Mark, where their solemn thanks were offered
up to God for this great blessing. Two days after, the
pope and cardinals went in procession to the church of
Minerva, when high mass was celebrated. The pope also
granted a jubilee to all Christendom, and one reason assigned
was, <i>that they should thank God for the slaughter
of the enemies of the church, lately executed in France</i>.
Two days later, the cardinal of Lorraine headed another
great procession of cardinals, clergy, and ambassadors, to the
chapel of St. Lewis, where he himself celebrated mass. In
the name of the king of France, the cardinal thanked the
pope and the cardinals, for the aid they had afforded his
majesty by their counsels and prayers, of which he had experienced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>the happy effects. On his own part, and on the
part of the church, the pope sent a legate to thank the king
for his zeal in the extirpation of the heretics, and to beseech
him to persevere in the great and holy work. The legate,
in passing through France, gave a plenary absolution to all
who had been actors in the massacre. On the evening of
the day on which the news arrived at Rome, the guns were
fired from the castle of St. Angelo; and the same rejoicings
were practised as were common on receiving the intelligence
of an important victory. The pope looked upon the massacre,
as one of the greatest felicities which could have
happened at the beginning of his papacy.</p>

<p>In addition to these public rejoicings on the part of the
pope and his cardinals at Rome, other means were adopted
to indicate the sense of the church on the massacre. Medals
were struck to commemorate the event. On the one side
was a representation of the slaughter, an angel cutting
down the heretics, and on the other, the head of the pope,
Gregory XIII. On these medals, was this inscription,
<i>&#8220;Ugonottorum Strages, 1572.&#8221;</i> The slaughter was also
deemed worthy of being commemorated on tapestry, which
was placed in the pope&#8217;s chapel. In the paintings which
were executed, the slaughter of the Huguenots was depicted,
<i>&#8220;Colignii et Sociorum c&aelig;des;&#8221;</i> and in another part, <i>&#8220;Rex
Colignii c&aelig;dam probat.&#8221;</i></p>

<p>Let it be remembered that the principles of the church
of Rome are unchanged, and, as the Romanists themselves
aver, unchangeable. The circumstances of Europe are
widely different from what they were in the sixteenth century;
and Romanists themselves are under the restraint of
wholesome laws and public opinion; but were the popes of
modern days to be supported by sovereigns like Charles IX.
of France, or were they possessed of the same power as
was once enjoyed by their predecessors, is it reasonable to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>suppose, that the principles which are still retained, would
not be carried out into practice; or that the same scenes,
which then disgraced the civilized world, would not again
be enacted in every country, in which the jesuits and other
active emissaries of the papacy could obtain a footing?</p>

<p>Is it not clear from the preceding facts, that the murderers
of Henry III. and IV. and the actors in the massacre
of St. Bartholomew considered that they were acting a
meritorious part? They were taught that the pope could
depose kings and grant their kingdoms to others; and they
knew that the pope had often exercised that power. The
Gunpowder conspirators were men of the same class and
influenced by the same views. Knowing that all heretics
are annually excommunicated, they believed that they were
authorized to carry the sentence into effect; and having
been taught that heretical princes might lawfully be deposed,
they considered themselves at liberty to attempt their destruction.
The assassins of the French monarchs and the
Gunpowder traitors, being encouraged by the authority of
the church, as explained by their spiritual directors, entered
upon their deeds of darkness, with an assurance, that they
were merely obeying the commands of their ghostly fathers.</p>

<p>The pope endeavoured to clear himself from the guilt
of being privy to the Gunpowder Treason; yet some
of the planners and contrivers of the plot were protected
at Rome. Had his holiness been sincere in his professions
to King James, he would have delivered up those
jesuits who were implicated in the treason, and who
escaped to Rome. The surrender of the conspirators
would have been the strongest proof of his sincerity.
But not only did he not give them up to the sovereign,
whose life they had sought; he did not even call them
to account for the part which they had taken in the
conspiracy. I would not charge the guilt of that conspiracy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>on the members of the church of Rome indiscriminately,
for there were many who were horror-struck at
the deed, and there always have been many who did not
receive all the principles maintained by the church; but I
contend, that the head of the church, the pope of that day,
approved of the act, or he would never have adopted the
course which he then pursued; and in his guilt all the leading
members of the conclave were also implicated. We can
only judge of men by their actions; which, if they mean
any thing, certainly involve the church of Rome of that
period in the guilt of the treason. Garnet was regarded as
a martyr, not as a traitor; and the absurd miracle of the
<i>Straw</i>, was sanctioned at Rome. These facts certainly involve
the then church of Rome in the treason; and as her
principles are unchanged, there would be no security against
the same practices, were circumstances to favour her ascendency<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>.</p>

<p>It is also worthy of remark, that the jesuits who were
privy to the design, and who escaped from the knife of the
executioner, never expressed the least remorse for the part
they had taken; on the contrary, they never failed to speak
of the treason as a glorious and meritorious deed. When
Hall the jesuit, <i>alias</i> Oldcorne, was reminded of the ill
success of the treason as a proof that it was displeasing to
God, he immediately replied, that the justice of the cause
must not be determined by the event, for that the eleven
tribes were commanded by God himself to fight against
Benjamin, and were twice overthrown; and that Lewis of
France was conquered by the Turks. By reminding some
of his dispirited companions of many glorious enterprises,
which had failed in the first instance, he hoped to encourage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>them to persevere, and to induce them to expect that God
would, in the end, enable them to accomplish their purposes.
Who can deny, after these facts, that the church of Rome
was deeply involved in the gunpowder treason? Or who
can exculpate her, even at present, from the charge of
maintaining principles subversive of Christian liberty and
Protestant governments? When one of the conspirators,
who was received by the governor of Calais, was condoled
with, on being banished his country, he replied, &#8220;It is the
least part of our grief that we are banished our native
country; this doth truly and heartily grieve us, that we could
not bring so generous and wholesome a design to perfection.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Everard Digby was a mild and amiable man, and,
with the exception of his participation in the plot, no stain
rests upon his character; yet he seems to have considered
that, by engaging in this treason, he was really doing God
service. His letters, written during his imprisonment, and
published by Bishop Barlow in 1679, illustrate the influence
of the principles of the church of Rome on the mind of an
otherwise excellent individual. They were written with
the juice of lemon, or something of the same kind: written,
too, when he had time to reflect in his solitary cell, yet it
is evident that he thought he was advancing the cause of
true religion in the part which he took; and, further, that
he was never convinced that the deed was sinful, so completely
had the jesuitical principles of the prime actors in
the conspiracy warped his judgment and influenced his
views. The papers were discovered in the house of Charles
Cornwallis, Esq., who was the executor of Sir Kenelm
Digby, the son and heir of Sir Everard. They were once
in the possession of Archbishop Tillotson, as he testifies in
one of his sermons.</p>

<p>The letters were by some secret means conveyed to his
lady, and were preserved in the family as sacred relics.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>&#8220;Sir Everard Digby,&#8221; says Archbishop Tillotson in his
sermon on the fifth of November, &#8220;whose very original
papers and letters are now in my hands, after he was in
prison, and knew he must suffer, calls it the best cause, and
was extremely troubled to hear it censured by Catholics and
priests, contrary to his expectations, for a great sin.&#8221; The
letters were also, once in the possession of Bishop Burnet,
as he himself informs us. From him we learn how they
were discovered. &#8220;The family being ruined upon the
death of Sir Kenelm&#8217;s son, when the executors were
looking out for writings to make out the titles of the
estates they were to sell, they were directed by an old
servant to a cupboard that was very artificially hid, in
which some papers lay that she had observed <i>Sir Kenelm</i>
was oft reading. They, looking into it, found a velvet bag,
within which, there were two other silk bags, (so carefully
were those relics kept) and there was within these a
collection of all the letters that <i>Sir Everard</i> writ during
his imprisonment.&#8221;</p>

<p>A few extracts will show what his sentiments were concerning
the plot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, for my intention let me tell you, that if I had
thought there had been the least sin in the plot, I would
not have been of it for all the world; and no other cause
drew me to hazard my fortune and life, but zeal to God&#8217;s
religion. For my keeping it secret, it was caused by
certain belief, that those which were best able to judge of
the lawfulness of it, had been acquainted with it, and given
way unto it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, let me tell you, what a grief it hath been to me,
to hear that so much condemned, which I did believe would
have been otherwise thought on by Catholics.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! how full of joy should I die, if I could do any
thing for the cause which I love more than my life.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>On the proceedings which were to have been adopted
in the event of the success of the plot, Sir Everard
remarks:</p>

<p>&#8220;There was also a course taken to have given present
notice to all princes, and to associate them with an oath,
answerable to the league in France.&#8221;</p>

<p>Respecting the pope&#8217;s concurrence he has the following
passage:</p>

<p>&#8220;Before that I knew any thing of the plot, I did ask
Mr. Farmer, what the meaning of the pope&#8217;s brief was: he
told me that they were not (meaning priests) to undertake
or procure stirs; but yet they would not hinder any,
neither was it the pope&#8217;s mind they should, that should be
undertaken for Catholic good. I did never utter thus much,
nor would not but to you; and this answer, with Mr.
Catesby&#8217;s proceedings with him and me, gave me absolute
belief that the matter in general was approved, though
every particular was not known.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then alluding to the presence of some Romanist peers
at the opening of parliament, he adds:</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not think there would have been three worth
saving that should have been lost.&#8221;</p>

<p>In another letter he observes:</p>

<p>&#8220;I could give unanswerable reasons, both for the good
that this would have done for the Catholic cause, and my
being from home, but I think it now needless, and for some
respects unfit.&#8221;</p>

<p>The last letter is a long one, and is addressed to his
sons; but though he exhorts them to continue in the faith
of the church of Rome, yet he does not express any sorrow
for his crime; nor does he caution them against being
engaged in similar conspiracies. It is, therefore, clear,
that he viewed the deed as laudable and meritorious, even
at the close of his career.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>It appears certain that many of the Romanists, both at
home and abroad, were aware that some extensive conspiracy
was on foot. A particular prayer was used, it is
said, by numbers in England, for the success of the conspiracy;
it was couched in the following terms: &#8220;Prosper,
Lord, their pains, that labour in thy cause day and night;
let heresy vanish like smoke; let the memory of it perish
with a crack, like the ruin and fall of a broken house.&#8221;
It would appear that this prayer was framed by one who
was privy to the conspiracy; nor can it be doubted that it
was intended to convey some intimation of the nature of the
treason. I am, aware, that no Romanist would in the
present day justify the deed; but the preceding facts prove,
that the act was applauded and justified at the time by the
whole church almost, and for a considerable period afterwards.
To justify the treason now, would be to expose
the parties who did so, to the execration of an indignant
public. The principles of Rome, however, are exactly
what they were when the bulls of the pope were sent to
Garnet, and when the gunpowder treason was planned.
Tillotson forcibly observes, &#8220;I would not be understood to
charge every particular person, who is, or hath been in the
Roman communion, with the guilt of those or the like
practices; but I must charge their doctrines and principles
with them. I must charge the heads of their church, and
the prevalent teaching and governing part of it, who are
usually the contrivers and abettors, the executioners and
applauders of these cursed designs<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was decided by Pope Urban II. that it was neither
treason nor murder to kill those, who were excommunicated
by the church. So that any treason or murder could be
justified on such principles. Nor has any change been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>effected in the principles of the church of Rome. &#8220;Popery,&#8221;
says Burnet, &#8220;cannot change its nature, and <i>cruelty and
breach of faith to heretics</i>, are as necessary parts of that
religion, as <i>transubstantiation</i> and the <i>pope&#8217;s supremacy</i><a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>.&#8221;
Andrew Marvel wittily remarks of the pope&#8217;s claim, &#8220;He
has, indeed, of late, been somewhat more retentive than
formerly as to his faculty of disposing of kingdoms, the
thing not having succeeded well with him in some instances,
but he lays the same claim still, continues the same inclinations,
and though velvet-headed hath the more itch to be
pushing. And, however, in order to any occasion he keeps
himself in breath, always by cursing one prince or other
upon every Maundy Thursday<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>.&#8221;</p>

<p class="summary long">THE ACT FOR THE OBSERVANCE OF THE DAY&mdash;A
SERVICE PREPARED FOR THE OCCASION&mdash;ALTERATIONS
IN THE SERVICE TO SUIT THE LANDING OF
KING WILLIAM&mdash;REFLECTIONS.</p>


<p class="newsection"><span class="smcap">As</span> the Act of Parliament which enjoins the observance of
the Fifth of November is not generally known, or at all
events is not within the reach of ordinary readers, I
shall insert in this place. It was couched in the following
terms:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Forasmuch as Almighty God hath in all ages shewed
his power and mercy, in the miraculous and gracious deliverance
of his Church, and in the protection of religious
kings and states, and that no nation of the earth hath been
blessed with greater benefits than this nation now enjoyeth,
having the true and free profession of the Gospel under
our most gracious Sovereign Lord King James, the most
great, learned, and religious king that ever reigned therein,
enriched with a most hopeful and plentiful progeny, proceeding
out of his royal loins, promising continuance of
this happiness and profession to all posterity: the which
many malignant and devilish papists, jesuits, and seminary
priests, much envying and fearing, conspired most horribly
when the king&#8217;s most excellent majesty, the queen, the
prince, and all the lords spiritual and temporal, and commons,
should have been assembled in the Upper House of
Parliament upon the Fifth day of November, in the year
of our Lord 1605, suddenly to have blown up the said
whole house with gunpowder: an invention so inhuman,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>barbarous, and cruel, as the like was never before heard of,
and was (as some of the principal conspirators thereof
confess) purposely devised and concluded to be done in the
said house, that when sundry necessary and religious laws
for preservation of the church and state were made, which
they falsely and slanderously call cruel laws, enacted against
them and their religion, both place and person should be
all destroyed and blown up at once, which would have
turned to the utter ruin of this whole kingdom, had it not
pleased Almighty God, by inspiring the king&#8217;s most excellent
majesty with a divine spirit, to interpret some dark
phrases of a letter shewed to his majesty, above and beyond
all ordinary construction, thereby miraculously discovering
this hidden treason not many hours before the appointed
time for the execution thereof: therefore the king&#8217;s most
excellent majesty, the lords spiritual and temporal, and all
his majesty&#8217;s faithful and loving subjects, do most justly
acknowledge this great and infinite blessing to have proceeded
merely from God his great mercy, and to his most
holy name do ascribe all honour, glory, and praise: and to
the end this unfeigned thankfulness may never be forgotten,
but be had in a perpetual remembrance, that all ages to
come may yield praises to his Divine Majesty for the same,
and have in memory this joyful day of deliverance:</p>

<p>&#8220;Be it therefore enacted, by the king&#8217;s most excellent
majesty, the lords spiritual and temporal, and the commons
in this present parliament assembled, and by the authority
of the same, that all and singular ministers in every cathedral,
and parish-church, or other usual place for common
prayer, within this realm of England, and the dominions
of the same, shall always upon the Fifth day of November
say morning prayer, and give unto Almighty God thanks
for this most happy deliverance: and that all and every
person and persons inhabiting within this realm of England,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>and the dominions of the same, shall always upon that day
diligently and faithfully resort to the parish-church or
chapel accustomed, or to some usual church or chapel,
where the said morning prayer, preaching, or other service
of God, shall be used, and then and there to abide orderly
and soberly during the time of the said prayers, preaching,
or other service of God there to be used and ministered.</p>

<p>&#8220;And because all and every person may be put in mind
of his duty, and be there better prepared to the said holy
service, be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, that every
minister shall give warning to his parishioners, publicly in
the church at morning prayer, the Sunday before every
such Fifth day of <i>November</i>, for the due observation of the
said day. And that after morning prayer or preaching on
the said Fifth day of <i>November</i>, they read publicly, distinctly,
and plainly, the present Act<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>.&#8221;</p>

<p>A particular service was prepared to be used on the
Fifth of November, and was published in 1606. I have
not been able to ascertain whether it was framed by the
convocation; but I am disposed to think that it was arranged
by the bishops, as is still the case in particular prayers on
special occasions, and then set forth by the authority of the
crown. In my copy of the original service printed by
Barker and Bill, printers to the king, the words &#8220;Set forth
by authority,&#8221; stand on the title-page. The authority of
the crown is evidently intended, and not that of convocation.</p>

<p>The original service was used on this day until the
alterations were effected in 1662, except during the period
of the Commonwealth, when forms of prayer were altogether
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>discarded. It appears, however, from Fuller, that
in his time, the observance of the day was very much
neglected. &#8220;If this plot,&#8221; says he, &#8220;had taken effect, the
papists would have celebrated this day with all solemnity;
and it would have taken the upper hand of all other
festivals. The more, therefore, the shame and pity, that
amongst Protestants the keeping of this day (not yet full
fifty years old) begins already to wax weak and decay; so
that the red letters, wherever it is written, seem to grow
dimmer and paler in our English calendar. God forbid
that our thankfulness for this great deliverance, formerly
so solemnly observed, should hereafter be like the <i>squibs</i>
which the apprentices in London make on this day; and
which give a great flash and crack at first, but soon go out
in a stink<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was written, or, at all events, the work was published,
during the Commonwealth; and it would seem that
the various religious parties of the period, though hostile
to popery, did not pay much attention to the observance of
the day, probably because it had been set apart as a holy
day by the church of England. The fact that the day was
observed by the Anglican church, was quite sufficient to
induce the presbyterians and sectaries to disregard it. On
no other ground can I account for the omission or neglect
of which Fuller speaks; for the religious parties of that
period, were all animated with feelings of the bitterest hostility
towards the church of Rome.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>After the restoration, the day was again solemnly observed
in all the churches of the kingdom; and when the
Book of Common Prayer was revised and set forth, the
service for the Fifth of November was revised also, and
published with the Liturgy. The original service was submitted
to the convocation, by whom several alterations were
made, which may be seen by comparing the service published
in 1606 with that which is annexed to the Common Prayer
subsequent to 1662, and which continued in that state until
after the Revolution. The title of the original service is,
<i>&#8220;Prayers and Thanksgiving to be used by all the King&#8217;s
Majestie&#8217;s loving Subjects, for the happy deliverance of
his Majesty, the Queen, Prince, and States of Parliament,
from the most traiterous and bloody intended massacre by
gunpowder, the 5 of November, 1605.&#8221;</i> In the service as
it was revised in 1662, some few alterations were made in
the title. They may be seen by any one, who compares the
above with the title in the service at present in use, for in
this particular it has undergone no change since 1662. In
the commencement of the original service are two verses
from 1 Timothy ii. 1, 2: in the revised form of 1662 they
are omitted. The rubrics, also, in the service of 1662,
respecting the method to be adopted when the day falls
upon a Sunday or holy-day, are not found in the service of
1606. The psalms appointed to be read are also different
in the two services. In the service as altered in 1662, and
as it stands at present, one of the homilies against rebellion
is appointed to be read, whenever there is no sermon, while
in that of 1606, no mention is made of anything of the
kind<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>.</p>

<p>The service of 1662, like the original, was framed to
commemorate one event only, namely, the deliverance from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>the gunpowder plot; but when King William came to the
throne, it was deemed desirable, as he had landed on the
same day, to commemorate that event also. It became necessary,
therefore, to alter the service so as to make it suit
both events; <i>first</i>, the deliverance from the gunpowder
treason; and <i>secondly</i>, the deliverance of the country from
popish tyranny and superstition by the arrival of King
William. It has been supposed, that the service was
altered into its present state by the convocation in 1689;
but there is no evidence to prove that such was the case.
It seems pretty certain that it was altered by the authority
of the crown. A twofold deliverance, therefore, is commemorated
in the present <i>service</i> for the Fifth of November;
<i>first</i>, from the powder plot, and <i>next</i>, from popery coming
in upon the country in a manner more insidious, but not
less dangerous in 1688, when the king on the throne was a
papist, and all possible means were used to establish the
papal ascendancy.</p>

<p>It was very natural, that the country should have been
struck with the circumstance of King William&#8217;s landing on
the Fifth of November,&mdash;a day so remarkable in the calendar
of the English church. To the Roman Catholics the
observance of this day is anything but agreeable; but they
can scarcely censure Englishmen for commemorating an
event so favourable to Protestantism. Had such a conspiracy
been discovered against the church of Rome, all
papists would regard the day with special reverence. Protestants
are surely to be permitted to enjoy the same liberty,
in celebrating the merciful interposition of Providence in
rescuing the country from destruction.</p>

<p>By some modern writers, the <i>Revolution</i> of 1688 is
designated a <i>Rebellion</i>! It is astonishing, that any Protestant
should speak of that event in such terms; since
Queen Victoria must be an usurper, if the revolution was a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>rebellion. To the principles then established, our queen is
indebted for her crown; and we are indebted to the same
principles, for our civil and religious liberties. The men,
who can call the revolution a rebellion, cannot be members
of the church of England; for had not King James been
expelled from the throne, the Anglican church would have
been destroyed. Rebellions can never be lawful; but revolutions,
similar to that in 1688, are perfectly just. Such
men can never read the Service appointed for the <i>Fifth of
November</i>; at all events, they cannot read the following
passages:&mdash;&#8220;Accept also, most gracious God, of our unfeigned
thanks, for filling our hearts again with joy and
gladness, after the time that thou hadst afflicted us, and
putting a new song into our mouths, by bringing his majesty
King <i>William</i>, upon this day, for the deliverance of our
church and nation from popish tyranny and arbitrary
power.&#8221; And again, &#8220;And didst likewise upon this day,
wonderfully conduct thy servant King <i>William</i>, and bring
him safely into <i>England</i>, to preserve us from the attempts
of our enemies to bereave us of our religion and laws.&#8221;
And the following, &#8220;We bless thee for giving his late
majesty King <i>William</i> a safe arrival here, and for making
all opposition fall before him, till he became our king and
governor.&#8221; It is not possible that the men, who can call the
revolution a rebellion, should concur in those prayers. Had
these individuals lived at the time, they would have quitted
the church with the nonjurors; and with such views, respecting
the revolution settlement, I cannot conceive how
they can conscientiously remain in a church connected with,
and supported by a government which owes its very existence
to that event, which they designate a rebellion. Is it
not high time for such men to quit the pale of the Anglican
church?</p>

<p>The dangers which threatened the country during the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>reign of James II. were very great; and their removal can
only be ascribed to Him, in whose hands are the issues of
life. James was determined to reduce the country into
subjection to the papal see, or lose all in the attempt.
William III. was the destined instrument under God, to
secure the liberties, which James laboured with all his
might to destroy. The revolution of 1688 was a bloodless
one; yet it was complete. It is always dangerous to alter
the succession to the crown; it is a expedient never to be
resorted to except in extreme danger. In 1688, the departure
from the direct line was an act of necessity; for
unless such a course had been adopted, the liberties of
England, both temporal and spiritual, would have been
sacrificed. Nor can any one say how long the country
would have been in recovering them from the grasp of the
papacy. In such an emergency the nation looked to the
prince of Orange, who responded to the call, and came to
our rescue. When King James quitted the country, and all
hope of his being prevailed upon to govern justly was lost,
the people saw the necessity of departing from the direct
line of succession. Still they were resolved to depart as
little as possible. They looked therefore to the next Protestant
heir, being determined to exclude papists from the
throne for ever. That <i>heir</i> was the princess of Orange,
the daughter of King James; and as the prince had been
so instrumental in rescuing the nation from the yoke, he
was associated with her in the government. James, therefore,
would not have been rejected if he had governed
righteously; but when he had deserted the throne, it was
determined that it should never again be filled with a papist.
Such were the principles on which the revolution was conducted.</p>

<p>When the prince of Orange set sail from Holland, he
was driven back by contrary winds; and it was feared that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>the attempt would fail, and that King James would succeed
in his designs. A second time, however, were the sails
unfurled, and a propitious wind bore the fleet to the coast of
Devon, where a landing was effected on the Fifth of
November, 1688.</p>

<p>The Fifth of November, 1605, and the Fifth of November,
1688, are remarkable days in the annals of England&mdash;days
never to be forgotten by a grateful people. Had not
the prince of Orange arrived, James would have imposed
his yoke upon the English nation. Had he not been
resisted, the laws and liberties of the country must have
been prostrated in the dust, and the church of England
sacrificed to popery.</p>

<p>King James, as a papist, felt himself bound to make
every effort to restore popery, and root out Protestantism.
All his actions tended to this point. Motives of policy
even did not restrain him in the course upon which he had
entered. His proceedings, therefore, were against the
liberties of the people, and the laws of the land; and on
this account alone was he set aside. The parliament acted
as a Protestant parliament, and enacted a law, that none but
a Protestant should ever occupy the British throne. The
parliament of that day well knew that the same principles
would be productive of similar results, and that Protestantism,
and the civil liberties of the nation, would be
endangered by a popish king. Now, had not King William
arrived, James would have been able to execute all his
projects respecting the church and nation; so that every
Protestant has reason to be thankful for the success, which
attended the efforts of William III., and to observe the
<i>Fifth of November</i> as a day of thanksgiving to God for his
gracious interposition.</p>

<p>Never was a people less disposed to rise against their
sovereign than were the English against James II. Yet, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>he was trampling upon their liberties, and preparing a yoke
of spiritual bondage, what could they do? Their rights as
men and as Christians were at stake; nor could the danger
by which they were threatened, be averted, but by the
expulsion of that sovereign, who had broken his solemn
promise, and proved himself unworthy of being trusted again
by his subjects. Our ancestors at the period of the revolution,
acted on the principle of self-defence. It was necessary
to deprive him of his royal power, when that power
would have been employed in depriving the people of their
civil and religious liberties.</p>

<p>It was admitted by an illustrious statesman in France,
in the seventeenth century, that it was the true interest of
England to maintain and defend her Protestant church
against popery. As his observations are so striking, and also
so applicable to our present circumstances, I shall not hesitate
to quote them. The book bears this title, <i>The Interest of
the Princes and States of Christendom</i>, and consists of
several chapters, in each of which he treats of <i>The Interest</i>
of a particular country. There is a chapter on <i>The Interest
of England</i>, from which I quote the following passages:
&#8220;Queen Elizabeth (who by her prudent government hath
equalled the greatest kings of Christendom), knowing well
the disposition of her state, believed that the true interest
thereof consisted, <i>first</i> in holding a firm union in itself,
deeming (as it is most true) that <i>England is a mighty
animal, which can never die except it kill itself</i>. She
grounded this fundamental maxim, <i>to banish thence the
exercise of the Roman religion</i>, as the only means to break
all the plots of the <i>Spaniards</i>, who under this pretext, did
there foment rebellion.&#8221; Alluding to some other particulars
of that reign he adds:&mdash;&#8220;By all these maxims, this
wise princess has made known to her successors that
besides the interest which the king of England has with all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>princes, he has yet one <i>particular</i>, which is that, <i>he ought</i>
thoroughly to acquire the advancement of the Protestant
religion, even with as much zeal as the King of Spain appears
protector of the Catholic.&#8221; This was the language
of a statesman. King James, therefore, did not seek the
<i>interest</i> of his country, but <i>that</i> of the papacy<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>.</p>

<p>A few words will suffice to shew that King James intended
to subvert the liberties of his subjects, to root out
Protestantism, and to re-establish popery.</p>

<p>In his first speech to his parliament, he promised to
support the church of England as by law established; yet,
two days after his accession, he went publicly to mass.
The very same year he appointed several popish officers to
posts in the army, in direct violation of the statute passed in
the late reign on this subject. In 1686, he endeavoured to
induce the twelve judges to declare the legality of the
<i>dispensing power</i>. While under the direction of a jesuit,
his confessor, a majority of papists were introduced into
his council; and at the same period several popish bishops
were publicly consecrated in St. James&#8217;s Chapel, contrary
to the laws of the land. Many of his nobles were removed
from their offices of trust and honour, simply for refusing
to embrace popery, while the clergy were commanded not
to introduce controversial topics into their sermons; and
because Sharp, subsequently archbishop of York, refused
to comply with the royal order, he was prosecuted in the
courts of justice, and his diocesan, the bishop of London,
was actually suspended for refusing to censure him contrary
to law. In 1687, under the pretence of relieving the dissenters,
he dispensed with the penal laws, in order that
popery might be propagated under cover of a toleration. In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>1688, seven bishops were committed to the Tower, for no
other crime than that of petitioning his majesty in favour of
the civil and religious liberties of the country. At length,
when the king&#8217;s designs were obvious to all men, the
prince of Orange was applied to by the general consent of
the English nation. That great prince responded to the
call, and, after some little delay at sea, landed on our shores
on the Fifth of November, 1688, and completed the deliverance
of the country from the yoke of bondage. Well,
therefore, may this event be coupled with the deliverance
of this nation from the Gunpowder Treason of 1605.</p>

<p>It must strike the reader as very strange, that in matters
of religion, we should not be left at liberty to act for ourselves,
without the interference of the pope and the Roman
church. This very fact shows, that her claim of supremacy
is an essential part of her system. The church of
England, the papists allege, has made a departure from the
church of Christ. This would be a grievous charge, if it
could be proved. The church of Christ commands nothing
but what is comformable to the Saviour&#8217;s will; nor does she
require her children to believe anything, which is not expressly
contained in the Scriptures, or by evident consequence
deduced from those sacred oracles. It is, therefore,
false to assert, that the church of England has made a separation
from the church of Christ. She merely opposes
those dogmas, which cannot be proved from sacred scripture.
So far from separating from the church of Christ,
she did not even separate from the church of Rome. The
church of England, in a lawful synod, assembled early in
the reign of Queen Elizabeth, declared certain opinions,
which were held by some in her communion, to be contrary
to the word of God. This power the church of England
ever possessed; and ages before the Reformation she had
often exercised it. This power had been wrested from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>church of England by force; and at the Reformation she
recovered it. William the Conqueror, and many of his
successors, though sons of the Roman church, yet acted as
independently as Queen Elizabeth. For ages our kings did
not permit letters to be received from Rome without being
submitted to their inspection: they did not permit any councils
to be held without their permission; so that ecclesiastical
councils were at length termed convocations, and were
always assembled by the authority of the crown. They
did not permit any synodical decree to take effect, but with
their concurrence, and confirmation. Bishops could not
excommunicate any baron or great officer without the royal
precept; or if they did, they were called to account for
their conduct in the courts of law. They never permitted
a legate from the pope to enter England, but by express
consent; nor did they suffer appeals to Rome, as was the
case when the encroachments of the papacy were further
advanced. Frequently they would not permit bishops to be
confirmed in their sees by the pope, but commanded the
archbishop of Canterbury to give possession to the individuals
appointed to fill them. These are a few instances
in which our kings in ancient times exercised a power in
ecclesiastical affairs independent of the pope; and, therefore,
Queen Elizabeth had a full right to act as her predecessors
had done for so many ages. The same power had
been possessed and exercised by every national church from
the earliest times. She proceeded, therefore, to correct
abuses; and the pope and his followers, without even examining
the matter, and setting at nought the ancient privileges
of the kingdom, designated this procedure a departure
from the church. The pope wished to impose, as
articles of belief, certain doctrines, which had no foundation
in Scripture: the English church refused to receive
them; and the pope condemned us as schismatics and heretics.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>Yet, in all reason those who depart from the Bible,
not those who adhere to it, must be the heretics. To impose
these same articles of belief the Gunpowder Treason
was planned! To impose the same, James II. resorted to
those means, which are so well known as having caused
him the loss of his crown. To commemorate our deliverance
from such an authority&mdash;from such a yoke of bondage&mdash;and
from such cruel tyranny, the Fifth of November was
ordered by act of parliament to be for ever kept holy.
That act is still in force; and I am convinced that it will
remain in force; for no minister of the crown, however inclined
to favour and conciliate the Papists, will ever be so
rash as to call for a repeal of that act. Such an attempt
would rouse the Protestant feeling of the empire: it
would be viewed as a precursor of the complete ascendency
of popery. I am convinced that the repeal of the act, if
such a thing were carried, would cause the Protestants of
England to observe the day with more solemnity than has
ever been practised since the passing of the act. Our
churches would be opened for worship; our pulpits would
resound with the full declaration of the truths of our holy
religion against the devices and the corruptions of popery;
and the loud song of praise and thanksgiving would be
offered up from England&#8217;s twelve thousand parishes, with
such ardour and devotional zeal, that no attempt to crush
the expression of public feeling would succeed. If, therefore,
a popishly affected ministry should ever venture to
repeal the act, they will be under the necessity, if they
would repress the demonstration of popular feeling, of passing
another act to prevent the doors of our churches from
being opened, and the people from assembling together to
praise God on the &#8220;Fifth of November.&#8221;</p>

<p>In alluding to the observance of the day, Burnet remarks,
&#8220;Now our Fifth of November is to be enriched by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>a second service, since God has ennobled it so far, as to be
the beginning of that which we may justly hope shall be
our complete deliverance from all plots and conspiracies;
and that this second day shall darken, if not quite wear
out the former<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>.&#8221; To us in the present day both deliverances
may be recalled with equal advantage. Both were
wonderful! Both demand a tribute of gratitude from all
who love the religion of the Bible. Burnet observes in the
same sermon, &#8220;You who saw the state of things three
months ago, could never have thought that so total a revolution
could have been brought about so easily as if it had
been only the shifting of scenes. These are speaking
instances to let you see of what consequence it is to a
nation to have the Lord for its God. We have seen it
hitherto in so eminent a manner, that we are forced to conclude
that we are under a special influence of heaven: and
since in God there is no variableness, nor shadow of turning,
we must confess that, if there comes any change in God&#8217;s
methods towards us, it arises only out of our ingratitude
and unworthiness.&#8221; He then states that, if the advantages
so conferred are not duly appreciated and improved, more
dreadful calamities than those lately expected will overtake
the country. When addressing the Commons on their
duties relative to religious matters, he tells them that one
important duty is, &#8220;to secure us for ever, as far as human
wisdom and the force of law can do it, from ever falling
under the just apprehensions of the return of idolatry
any more amongst us, and the making the best provision
possible against those dangers that lay on us so lately<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>.&#8221;</p>

<p>I am disposed to think, that the act of parliament by
which the observance of the day is enjoined, is not read, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>the present day, in our churches: some of the clergy have
never even seen it. The present work is intended to call
the attention of churchmen, and especially of the clergy,
to this important subject. Should I be assured, that any
of my brethren have been led, by the perusal of this
volume, to regard the day with more solemnity than usual,
I shall feel myself amply recompensed for my labours. At
the period of the Revolution, and for many years after, the
act, as we learn from incidental notices of contemporary
writers, was always read by the clergy from the pulpits.
The people were then fully sensible of the deliverance,
which had been completed on that day; while the clergy
invariably directed the attention of their parishioners to
the subject; and both clergy and people presented their
tribute of gratitude to that gracious Being from whom all
good things proceed. And why should the present generation
be less mindful of the great deliverance than their
ancestors? We have just as much reason to be thankful
as the men of that generation; for if the papists had succeeded
in their designs, not only would the liberties of that
age have been sacrificed, but those also of succeeding
periods. May the Protestants of this kingdom never be
forgetful of the glorious Arm by which our salvation from
papal thraldom and error was alone effected! It is generally
allowed that a retrospection into the transactions of
past ages is as a glass, in which the clearest view of future
events may be obtained: for, by comparing things together,
we shall arrive at this conclusion, that men of the same
principles will always, either directly or indirectly, aim at
the same ends. The end, which all Romanists have in
view, is the destruction of the church of England as the
greatest bulwark of Protestantism. In past ages this end
was sought to be accomplished directly by treason and
murder; in the present day the end is attempted by secret
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>means, by an affectation of moderation, and by an avowal
of sentiments which are not in reality maintained. Let
Protestants ever bear in mind, that the same causes will
generally produce the same effects, though the means employed
may be varied according to times and circumstances.
Ever since the revolution in 1688, popery, in this country,
has worn a mask; but the papal party are now venturing
to cast it aside, and to appear in their real character.
Within the last few years scenes have been exhibited in
this Protestant land, which our ancestors would never for
one moment have tolerated. Many Protestants are lukewarm
amid these ominous proceedings. May they be
aroused from their present apathy into a spirit worthy of
the men, by whom our deliverance from papal tyranny was
effected in <span class="smcap">One Thousand Six Hundred and Eighty-Eight</span>.</p>
